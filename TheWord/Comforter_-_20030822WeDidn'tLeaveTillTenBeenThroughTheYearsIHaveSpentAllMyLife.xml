   <Word>Ten ... Years</Word>
   <Commentary>
Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife (Genesis 16:3).
They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years (Ruth 1:4).
