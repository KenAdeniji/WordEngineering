   <Commentary>
By night on my bed I sought Him whom my soul loves: I sought Him, but I found Him not (Song of Solomon 3:1). 
I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek Him whom my soul loves: I sought Him, but I found Him not (Song of Solomon 3:2). 
The wind shall eat up all your pastors, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness (Jeremiah 22:22). 
Father, I will that they also, whom You have given me, be with Me where I AM; that they may behold My glory, which You have given Me: for You loved Me before the foundation of the world (John 17:24). 
Wherefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of Him in peace, without spot, and blameless (2 Peter 3:14).

   <Commentary>Only God can make Me rise. But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart (Daniel 2:30). 50 days: 1 biblical month and 20 days.</Commentary>
