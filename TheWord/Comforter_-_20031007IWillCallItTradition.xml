  <Prophet>

   <Commentary>
Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread (Matthew 15:2).
But He answered and said unto them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? (Matthew 15:3).
And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition (Matthew 15:6).
For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders (Mark 7:3).
Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, Why walk not Your disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? (Mark 7:5).
For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things you do (Mark 7:8).
He said unto them, Full well you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition (Mark 7:9).
Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which you have delivered: and many such like things do you (Mark 7:13).
And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers (Galatians 1:14).
Beware less any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ (Colossians 2:8).
Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle (2 Thessalonians 2:15).
Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us (2 Thessalonians 3:6).
Forasmuch as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers (1 Peter 1:18).
