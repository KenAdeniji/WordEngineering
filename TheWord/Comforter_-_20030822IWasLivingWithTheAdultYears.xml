   <Word>Signet</Word>
   <Commentary>
He said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your signet, and your bracelets, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him (Genesis 38:18).
When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray you, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff (Genesis 38:25).
With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shall you engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel: you shall make them to be set in ouches of gold (Exodus 28:11).
The stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes (Exodus 28:21).
You shall make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD (Exodus 28:36).
They wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel (Exodus 39:6).
The stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes (Exodus 39:14).
They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD (Exodus 39:30).
As I live, said the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck the thence (Jeremiah 22:24).
A stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel (Daniel 6:17).
In that day, said the LORD of hosts, will I take you, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, said the LORD, and will make you as a signet: for I have chosen you, said the LORD of hosts (Haggai 2:23).
