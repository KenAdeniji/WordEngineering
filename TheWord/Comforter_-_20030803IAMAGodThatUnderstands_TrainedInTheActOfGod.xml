   <Word>God ... understands</Word>
   <Commentary>Solomon my son, know you the God of your father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts: if you seek Him, He will be found of you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off for ever (1 Chronicles 28:9). God understands the way thereof, and He knows the place thereof (Job 28:23). Have you not known? have you not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faints not, neither is weary? there is no searching of His understanding (Isaiah 40:28).</Commentary>
