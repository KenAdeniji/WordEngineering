  <Commentary>
   Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem (Matthew 2:1). 
   Saying, Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the East, and are come to worship Him (Matthew 2:2). 
   When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the East, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was (Matthew 2:9).
   When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy (Matthew 2:10).

   <Word>Prince East</Word>
   <Commentary>
A portion shall be for the Prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border (Ezekiel 45:7). 
It shall be the Prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: He shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house (Ezekiel 45:17).
Now when the Prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open Him the gate that looks toward the east, and He shall prepare His burnt offering and His peace offerings, as He did on the sabbath day: then He shall go forth; and after His going forth one shall shut the gate (Ezekiel 46:12).
The residue shall be for the Prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the Prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof (Ezekiel 48:21).
