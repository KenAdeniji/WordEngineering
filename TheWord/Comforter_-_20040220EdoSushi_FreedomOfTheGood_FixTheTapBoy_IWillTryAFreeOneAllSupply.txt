Freedom of the good republic.
Fix the tap boy.
I will try a free one, all supply.
Someone you hope, someone you like, someone who will understand, someone special man.
Never mind the call, When you are standing, I am standing with you.
Their are enough men in China to wet the garden in heaven.
The glass illustrates the man, and the woman dances through.
The interpretation of dreams, the telling of tales.
Begin in hope.
We redo ourself.
Don't go away without me.
In whose tender arms will you lay tonight, I laid you, last night.
You laugh quietly, you talk smoothly.
Tangle along.
Fake on red.
