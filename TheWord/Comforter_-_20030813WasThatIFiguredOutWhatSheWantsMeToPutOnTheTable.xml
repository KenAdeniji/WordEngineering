   <Word>Figure</Word>
   <Commentary>
Less you corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female (Deuteronomy 4:16).
He carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without (1 Kings 6:29).
The carpenter stretched out his rule; he marks it out with a line; he fits it with planes, and he marks it out with the compass, and makes it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house (Isaiah 44:13).
Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience (Hebrews 9:9).
For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us (Hebrews 9:24).
Accounting that God was able to raise Him up, even from the dead; from whence also He received Him in a figure (Hebrews 11:19).
The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ (1 Peter 3:21).
