  <Commentary>The glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud (Exodus 24:16). Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he (Matthew 11:11).</Commentary>

   <Word>Infirmities (New Testament)</Word>
   <Commentary>
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses (Matthew 8:17).
But so much the more went there a fame abroad of Him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities (Luke 5:15).
In that same hour He cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind He gave sight (Luke 7:21).
Certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils (Luke 8:2).
Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (Romans 8:26).
We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves (Romans 15:1).
If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities (2 Corinthians 11:30).
Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities (2 Corinthians 12:5).
He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for you: for My strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me (2 Corinthians 12:9).
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong (2 Corinthians 12:10).
Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities (1 Timothy 5:23).
For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15).
