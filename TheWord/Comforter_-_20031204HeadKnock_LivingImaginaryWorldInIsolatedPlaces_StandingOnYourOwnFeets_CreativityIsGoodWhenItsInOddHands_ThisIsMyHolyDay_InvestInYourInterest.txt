Dagba sile.
E pe le iya mi.
Welcome into the youth world.
Live in wisdom, warrant yours.
Bowo fun mi, leni.
Head knock.
Taiye, Kehinde, awon fego forward.
Always on the barometer.
Lori bed.
Living imaginary world in isolated places.
Standing on your own feets.
Creativity is good when its in odd hands.
Moni kolo rami ni.
Will you love me when I go away?
What do you say to baba to wipe ohun fe feran e, sugbon ohun mo bo ya oni ran lowo.
This is my holy day.
Invest in your interest.
Five is what I am, ten is what He is, guaranty given.
If no counsel, extend the maturity date.
Remember the acting name.
Groom, manicure exteriors, safely.
You investigate collateral links.
