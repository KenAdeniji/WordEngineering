   <Word>As ... Walking</Word>
   <Commentary>
    Jesus saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night He came unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them (Mark 6:48).
    He looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking (Mark 8:24).
    They came again to Jerusalem: and as He was walking in the temple, there come to Him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders (Mark 11:27).
    Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts (2 Peter 3:3).
