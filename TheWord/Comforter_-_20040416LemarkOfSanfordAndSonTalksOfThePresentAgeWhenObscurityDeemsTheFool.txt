Lemark of Sanford & Son talks of the present age when obscurity deems the fool.
Why imitate the fool when he has no sons.
God thank you, God I am grateful.
Too many layers of shame.
A slime of robbers.
A token fool when ransom is needed.
I used to ask when does dormancy obey durancy.
I want a gangstar.
I want a gangstar through the stars that will never rise.
I want a gangstar, bang stairs!!!
I think their is a lacking in you, and this is a stimulus to fulfill that gap.
