   <Commentary>
Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, less their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and less they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD has not done all this (Deuteronomy 32:27).
David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants (1 Samuel 18:5).
David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him (1 Samuel 18:14).
Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him (1 Samuel 18:15).
Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by (1 Samuel 18:30).
Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in His sight (1 Chronicles 19:13).
I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourns for his mother (Psalms 35:14).
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when will You come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart (Psalms 101:2).
Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child (Psalms 131:2).
The people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable (Isaiah 3:5).
Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but He will not hear them: He will even hide His face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings (Micah 3:4).
But if any man think that he behaves himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sins not: let them marry (1 Corinthians 7:36).
Does not behave itself unseemly, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil (1 Corinthians 13:5).
You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe (1 Thessalonians 2:10).
For yourselves know how you ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you (2 Thessalonians 3:7).
But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth (1 Timothy 3:15).
