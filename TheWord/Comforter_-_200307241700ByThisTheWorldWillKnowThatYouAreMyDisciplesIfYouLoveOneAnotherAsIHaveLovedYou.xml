      <Word>Patience</Word>
      <Commentary>But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience (Luke 8:15). In your patience possess you your souls (Luke 21:19). But we glory in tribulations: knowing that tribulation works patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope (Romans 5:3-4). For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus (Romans 15:4-5). Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds (2 Corinthians 12:12). Strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness (Colossians 1:11). Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father (1 Thessalonians 1:3). So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure (2 Thessalonians 1:4). But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness (1 Timothy 6:11). But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience (2 Timothy 3:10). That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience (Titus 2:2). Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus (Revelation 14:12).
