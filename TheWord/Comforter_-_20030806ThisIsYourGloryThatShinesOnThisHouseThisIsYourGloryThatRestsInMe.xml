   <Word>Glory ... Rest</Word>
   <Commentary>
    Shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer faints (Isaiah 10:18).
    Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of Your holiness and of Your glory: where is Your zeal and Your strength, the sounding of Your bowels and of Your mercies toward me? are they restrained? (Isaiah 63:15).

   <Commentary>At the intersection of Fremont Blvd and Eggers Street, 10 birds will fly towards the right away from the side of Washington High School towards the side of Prince of Peace. Highway 880 Stevenson Blvd: the half moon curved towards the right is on the left hand side towards 880 South; and the full sun is on the right hand side towards 880 North. A dime, D 1998, EPLU RIB USU NUM, will fall down in front of three carts in the front of the shop. Re-order: AlphabetSequence 480, and 481. AlphabetSequence 480, AlphabetSequenceIndex 477: Is their a way to bring all these things into being? AlphabetSequence 481, AlphabetSequenceIndex 927: This is Your glory that shines on this House; This is Your glory that rests in Me. The difference between both AlphabetSequenceIndexes 477 and 927 is 450 (Genesis 18:25, Job 14, Isaiah 61, 2 John 1:7).</Commentary>
