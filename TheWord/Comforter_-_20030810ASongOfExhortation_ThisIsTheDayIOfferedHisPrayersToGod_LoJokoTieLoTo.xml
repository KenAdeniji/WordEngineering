   <Word>A Song</Word>
   <Commentary>
I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify Him with thanksgiving (Psalms 69:30).
For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs (Psalms 137:3).
You shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One (Isaiah 30:29).
