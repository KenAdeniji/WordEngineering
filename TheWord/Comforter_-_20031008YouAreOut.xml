   <Commentary>
    Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: (Leviticus 18:24).
    Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if you can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments: (Judges 14:12). 
    Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel, saying, If you do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve Him only: and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines (1 Samuel 7:3). 
    Ten young men that bare Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him (2 Samuel 18:15). 
    The king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city (2 Kings 7:12). 
    That which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: (Ezra 6:9).
    The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant (Jeremiah 2:15). 
    Therefore this said the Lord GOD; Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it (Ezekiel 11:7). 
    Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness (Matthew 23:27). 
    The foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out (Matthew 25:8). 
    He said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables: (Mark 4:11). 
    This I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction (1 Corinthians 7:35).
