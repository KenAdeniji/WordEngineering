   <Word>Their ... Way</Word>
   <Commentary>
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away (Psalms 90:10).
To call passengers who go right on their ways (Proverbs 9:15).
As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception (Hosea 9:11).
It was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away (John 19:31).
But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ (2 Corinthians 3:14).
Many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of (2 Peter 2:2).
