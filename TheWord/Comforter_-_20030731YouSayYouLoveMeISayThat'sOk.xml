   <Word>Daughter in law</Word>
   <Commentary>
    Eli's daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her (1 Samuel 4:19).
