   <Word>Gracious ... Mercy</Word>
   <Commentary>
God said, I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy (Exodus 33:19).
For if you turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away His face from you, if you return unto Him (2 Chronicles 30:9).
Has God forgotten to be gracious? has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah (Psalms 77:9).
But You, O Lord, are a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth (Psalms 86:15).
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yes, our God is merciful (Psalms 116:5).
The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy (Psalms 145:8).
Therefore will the LORD wait, that He may be gracious unto you, and therefore will He be exalted, that He may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for Him (Isaiah 30:18).
Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents Him of the evil (Joel 2:13).
He prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray You, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that You are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repent you of the evil (Jonah 4:2).

   <Commentary>
I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happens to them all (Ecclesiastes 9:11).
As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams (Daniel 1:17).
He informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give you skill and understanding (Daniel 9:22).
