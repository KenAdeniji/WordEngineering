   <Commentary>
    Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together (Genesis 22:8).
    Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death (Genesis 24:67).
    Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses (Exodus 1:20-21).
