   <Word>Storm</Word>
   <Commentary>
The east wind carried him away, and he departed: and as a storm hurls him out of his place (Job 27:21).
There shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain (Isaiah 4:6).
For you have been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall (Isaiah 25:4).
Behold, the LORD has a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand (Isaiah 28:2).
You shall ascend and come like a storm, you shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your bands, and many people with you (Ezekiel 38:9).
But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy (Luke 8:23).
