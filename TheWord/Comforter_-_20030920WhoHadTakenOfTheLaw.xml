  <Prophet>

   <Commentary>
    From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. 
    For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
    And if you will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. 
    He that has ears to hear, let him hear. 
    But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, 
    And saying, We have piped unto you, and you have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and you have not lamented. 
    For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil. 
    The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children
    (Matthew 11:12-19).
