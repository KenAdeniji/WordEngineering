   <Commentary>Germany shares border with Netherlands/Holland. The 2 visits made to Manly were with William Eguaibor, and Pauline Beshay on 2 separate occassions. During the visit with William Eguaibor, Shaheed Ali shared PowerBuilder introductory knowledge; however, earlier in the day prior to visiting with William, Pauline Beshay just returned from Newcastle vacation and was on her period; therefore, she offered a long endowed fellatio. Pauline Beshay and I visited Manly beach, we ate at an Egyptian restaurant with the Egyptian cook/waiter having an upper hand, but both Manly's residents Shaheed Ali and Mark Wilson were not available to meet.</Commentary>

   <Commentary>In the first dream, I followed the cue of the church congregation whom solicit neighborhood affection, however, I did not succumb to the first initiative. In the second dream, Shaheed Ali and an unidentified female live-in, playing cards, agree that a male should be a torch bearer. Card games traditionally commence with random card shuffles, mastery may yield victory. Mark Wilson conceeded Metal Manufacture's (MM) Port Kembla stale, non-variety, after the network, database, and framework deployment.</Commentary>
