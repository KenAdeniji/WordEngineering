   <Commentary>
The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another (Exodus 26:3).
You shall make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle (Exodus 26:26).
Five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward (Exodus 26:27).
You shall make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and you shall cast five sockets of brass for them (Exodus 26:37).
You shall make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits (Exodus 27:1).
He coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another (Exodus 36:10).
He made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle (Exodus 36:31).
Five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward (Exodus 36:32).
The five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass (Exodus 36:38).
Then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar (1 Kings 6:10).
Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits (1 Kings 6:24).
He made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits (1 Kings 7:16).
He put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south (1 Kings 7:39).
The candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold (1 Kings 7:49).
One wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub (2 Chronicles 3:12).
Every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed (Ezekiel 40:7).
The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within (Ezekiel 41:9).
The doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about (Ezekiel 41:11).
Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches (John 5:2).
