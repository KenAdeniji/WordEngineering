   <Commentary>
   We 've asked that You train them.
   It has not been done as an act of war, it has been done as act of obedience to You.
   There are still people to be saved.
   A talent is a bloody thing to waste.
   LORD, continue to love, Yourself.
   May be the next generation can see things in a different way, given the opportunity.
   LORD, God for this is Your time on earth.
   We have agreed for You to bury Your dead.
   That I may fulfill Your will.
   Their is a glory ...
   For the time has come to fulfill Your will.
