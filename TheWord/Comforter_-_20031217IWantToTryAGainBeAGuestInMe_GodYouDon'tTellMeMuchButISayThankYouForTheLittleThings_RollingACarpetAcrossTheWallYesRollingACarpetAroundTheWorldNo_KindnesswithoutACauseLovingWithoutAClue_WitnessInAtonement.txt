I want to try a gain? Be a guest in me.
God, You don't tell me much, but I say thank You for the little things.
Rolling a carpet across the wall, Yes. Rolling a carpet around the world, No.
God in all things You 've been kind to me, but in no things have you been mean to me.
Kindness without a cause, loving without a clue.
Witness in atonement.
