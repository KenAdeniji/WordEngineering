   <Commentary>
    The Man said to Me, "Son of Man, look with Your with Your eyes and hear with Your ears and pay attention to everything I AM going to show You, for that is why You have been brought here. Tell the house everything You see."
    (Ezekiel 40:4).
    This is what the LORD says: 'Out of your own household I AM going to bring calamity upon you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he lie with your wives in broad daylight.
    You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight
    (2 Samuel 12:11-12).

   <Word>I have said</Word>
   <Commentary>
    I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey (Exodus 3:17).
    In all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth (Exodus 23:13).
    But I have said unto you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that flows with milk and honey: I AM the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people (Leviticus 20:24).
    But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance (Numbers 18:24).
    For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: Your faithfulness shall You establish in the very heavens (Psalms 89:2).
    But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you (John 14:26).
