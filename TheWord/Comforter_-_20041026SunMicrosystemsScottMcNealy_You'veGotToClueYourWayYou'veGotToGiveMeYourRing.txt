You've got to clue your way; you've got to give me your ring.
Wide Gaps
I find it admirable that in our quality shop we don't find an amusement park.
We don't find littered with incumbent goods.
We see too many people prevailing history.
God gather the dust as we gather the scatter.
The isolation of the ages.
We fought for what we did not privilege.
