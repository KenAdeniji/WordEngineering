How do I build my house without hostage?
Who was the writer with purpose?
How should I man the man, when he is less driven.
We feel we can no longer grow, so we've suspended living.
We seek independent view, but we have surrogate relationships.
I feel fitter in universal clothing, unrestricted by unusual environment.
We can not limit pass our luxury.
Don't ampute the leg you can't use.
We've tendered our hands to expendable hands.
