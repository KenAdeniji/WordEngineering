    <Commentary>Nicole Thorn with supposedly Asian blood is an adopted daughter of a deceased Caucasian police officer. Friday Stance Aighoume befriended Nicole Thorn a virgin while both worked at Arnotts biscuits, subsequenrly, Stance returned to Benin to find a suitable wife. Nicole Thorn and Johnny made fun of each at Arnotts biscuits but slept off hours. Nicole Thorn and I ran into each other at Town Hall Sydney New South Wales (NSW) Australia. After our 3rd love make session, God said Nicole Thorn is playing on the field against the North West goal post with police tips. Nicole Thorn and Charles Omoruyi traded sex. Sadly it is not to date.</Commentary>
