   <Commentary>
    Eliab, David's eldest brother, heard when he spoke unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why come you down hither? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you are come down that you might see the battle (1 Samuel 17:28). To godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity (2 Peter 1:7). All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds (1 Corinthians 15:39). Of His own will begat He us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures (James 1:18). For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind (James 3:7).
