   <Word>Moment</Word>
   <Commentary>
For His anger endures but a moment; in His favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning (Psalms 30:5).
I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: less any hurt it, I will keep it night and day (Isaiah 27:3).
In a little wrath I hid My face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you, said the LORD your Redeemer (Isaiah 54:8).
Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at you (Ezekiel 26:16).
Yes, I will make many people amazed at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall (Ezekiel 32:10).
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed (1 Corinthians 15:52).
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory (2 Corinthians 4:17).
