   <Commentary>
Jesus said unto him, You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind (Matthew 22:37).
You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength: this is the first commandment (Mark 12:30).
He answering said, you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself (Luke 10:27).
Seek not you what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, neither be you of doubtful mind (Luke 12:29).
