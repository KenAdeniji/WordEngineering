Among the Family
Is the spiritual lease.
Accomodate the places I AM found.
Hello sometimes this is my song to you. Hello this is my long distance sound.
I send all the gifts to you, but only in the Arms of God did I leave the present.
The flock that I see is You, the float that is rising?
In every of my testimony, I make heaven a sentence.
If you ask Me to come, where would you place Me?
Let her, can go
If I were to ask for the present, how do I seek the future?
It is the love that you know. It is the love that you love.
If their is ever a liver, this is mine.
The god of our ancestors did not choose as the favorite, we chose ourself as the first born.
I serve my solitude in His observance.
If its living, I want to shelter it.
If I were to ask God to come in, should I ask for an outsider?
If you were to pool, would you know the seed?
Every day He takes our requests and re-iterates our actions.
I have sold.
Ain't no winner when I am weaning you.
Why saddle our children?
How many paces out march the farm?
Oh LORD, thank You for You and me.
Feel me up and burst me up.
If you were to tell me the later days, how can I get here now?
This is the way I grief, when I cry the unending.
What God has made why untouch?
If their was to be, how do we forestall it?
Is it only you that tithes? Is it only you that thirst?
Their are no biblical position that let's standing down.
