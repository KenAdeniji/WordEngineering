   <Commentary>
    Never focus on anything else, except what God is saying to You.
    A prophet's reward.
    Dublin Blvd: 3 birds will fly towards the left ... Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them (Judges 2:16).
    When the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them (Judges 2:18).
