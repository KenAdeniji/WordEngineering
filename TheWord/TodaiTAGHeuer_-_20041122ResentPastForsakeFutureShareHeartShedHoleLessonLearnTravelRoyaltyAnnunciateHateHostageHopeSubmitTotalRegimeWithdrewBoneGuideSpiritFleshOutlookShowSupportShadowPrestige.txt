We do not resent the past, we forsake the future.
I share the heart, I shed the hole.
All the lessons he had learnt, we travelled in.
We thirst for rain, we drained blood.
If it ain't moving God, it ain't dropping.

We are not submissive to its totalitarian regime, so it withdrew its support.
The bones guides the spirit, the flesh outlooks the show.
A shadow of his prestige.
