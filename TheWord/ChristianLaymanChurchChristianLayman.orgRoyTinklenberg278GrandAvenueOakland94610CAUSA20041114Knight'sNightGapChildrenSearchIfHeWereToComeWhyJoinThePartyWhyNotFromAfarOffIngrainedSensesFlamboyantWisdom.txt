Oh for the knight's night should gap?
It has never understand what it is trying to do, or it is doing.
God has not made us alike, why differentiate us?
He seems like a stranger in a family land.
In your heart, I have sown my own being.
So if I have given Him children, why do I still search Him?
What is my shadow matching you?
If he were to come why join the party? Why not from afar off?
If we will rest, He will obey.
We must build true spirit ingrained in our senses that we may flamboyant in His wisdom.
