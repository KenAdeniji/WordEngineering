Shame, betray.
We contribute our sense, we seek Your soul.
All I saw is a soul wretched, but observant of the times.
May you look at the child and see you grow; may you look at the old and see you frail.
The mistakes are minuses, the progress are pluses.
Who can go among us? When we are alert.
Further to the right, their is friend, my majestic hope.
Mitigate the risk of your ancestors, by descending to the rest.
Tatters, tantrums, soiled.
