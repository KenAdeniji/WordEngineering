   <Word>Day Well ... God</Word>
   <Commentary>
    I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go: (Genesis 24:42).
    You shall keep therefore His statutes, and His commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days upon the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever (Deuteronomy 4:40).
    Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before Him (Ecclesiastes 8:12).
    But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall He prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because He fears not before God (Ecclesiastes 8:13).
