   <Commentary>
By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations (Genesis 10:5).
Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence (Psalms 91:3).
The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him (Ezekiel 7:15).
But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months (Revelation 11:2).
