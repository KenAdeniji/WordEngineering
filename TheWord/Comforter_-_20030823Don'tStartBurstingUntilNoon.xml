   <Word>Burst</Word>
   <Commentary>
Behold, my belly is as wine which has no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles (Job 32:19).
So shall your barns be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst out with new wine (Proverbs 3:10).
He shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit (Isaiah 30:14).
For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot (Jeremiah 2:20).
I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds (Jeremiah 5:5).
For it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him (Jeremiah 30:8).
For now will I break his yoke from off you, and will burst your bonds in sunder (Nahum 1:13).
No man puts new wine into old bottles: else the new wine does burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles (Mark 2:22).
No man puts new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish (Luke 5:37).
Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out (Acts 1:18).
