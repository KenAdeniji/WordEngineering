This is the day, I have a choice, you.
God, I heard Your prayer, and I showed Your name.
In the lacklustre years, you remind me of heaven; in the fortune years, you remind me of hell.
This is my love shared with you, my teach.
Oh, somebody is locked out.
Irekun, I love you.
I know what it takes.
Higher up the fence.
Oma ko le mi.
I gather My sheep as I gather you.
Irekun o lo mo, may be you will leave a message.
For the two of you.
Ire mi fun Olodumare.
Awon lo pe. Awon omi ajiya.
I now carry you together.
Our time.
Perception in wonderment.
Never know until God come.
Treat people the same way you want to treat.
