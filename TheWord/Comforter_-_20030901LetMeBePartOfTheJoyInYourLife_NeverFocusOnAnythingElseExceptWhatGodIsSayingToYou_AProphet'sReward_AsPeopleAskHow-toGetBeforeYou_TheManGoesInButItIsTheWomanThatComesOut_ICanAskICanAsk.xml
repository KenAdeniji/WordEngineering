   <Commentary>
    A certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth (Luke 1:5).
    Entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth (Luke 1:40).
    For He has regarded the low estate of His handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed
    For He that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is His name. 
    And His mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation 
    (Luke 1:48-50).
    Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them (Judges 2:16).
    When the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them (Judges 2:18).
    Solomon's son was Rehoboam, Abia his son, Asa his son, Jehoshaphat his son (1 Chronicles 3:10).
