The first declaration removes the default HTML list bullets.
The second declaration places small (1x80 pixels) image in the background (repeated automatically.)
The third declaration sets the height of the list. 
The fourth declaration sets the width of the list.
The fifth declaration is voluntary. Auto margin will center the list within its parent element.

/*
The first declaration places a small (2x80 pixels) background image to each link. 
The background image works as a divider between the links (picture 5). 
The second declaration forbids the repeating of the background image.
The third declaration defines the location of the background image.
The fourth and fifth declaration create padding around each link.
The sixth declaration makes the whole block clickable (instead of just the text)
The seventh declaration sets the height of the link. This is needed so that the whole height of the block would be clickable. This also centers the text vertically.
The eighth declaration removes the underlining from the links.
The 9th - 11th declarations are just for styling the text.
