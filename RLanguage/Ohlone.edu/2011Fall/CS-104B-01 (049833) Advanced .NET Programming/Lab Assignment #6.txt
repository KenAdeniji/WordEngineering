Create a Web application that displays the Products tables in the Northwind database.  Your Web application allows 
the user to update the data in the product table. Hint: The product table has constraints.    You can use DetailsView
with pagination.  Please see week 9 hands on example for how to.

Optional:

Use WCF Service to retrieve the data or SQLDataSource. Please see Week 7 HandsOn example as your reference.
