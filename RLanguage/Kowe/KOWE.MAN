                               KOWE   MANUAL

KOWE is a complete word processing package, and it is very simple and
easy to use.  For person who has had previous background using the type
writer or wordprocessor, the transition to KOWE should be free of any major
hitches.  A computer literate, who may have done word processing on the
computer does not require any training to use KOWE.  However, so our
customers can extensively understand KOWE's operation and explore its
numerous features, this fully documented manual has been provided.


                           SYSTEM   REQUIREMENTS
   

               -    IBM  Personal Computer  or  Compatible

               -    Graphics Monitor

                                                                            

                               INSTALLATION


KOWE does not require detailed installation, the only procedure performed
is to copy KOWE onto the backup diskette / hard disk.  As a precautionary
measure, we suggest you do not use the original KOWE diskette for your
wordprocessing, but rather you use your copied version.  User is permitted
to make only one backup copy, and install KOWE on only one hard disk
system.


INSTALLATION  FOR  FLOPPY  USERS

It is suggested, that two diskettes be used for wordprocessing.  The first
floppy will contain the backup copy, and the other floppy will be used as
document diskette.  The document diskette will be used for storage and
retrieval of documents done in KOWE.  The floppy installation procedure
is shown below:

     1.   Make backup copy of original KOWE's diskette.

          Syntax:

               DISKCOPY   <Source Drive>  <Target Drive>                    
              
          Example:

               DISKCOPY  A:   A:

     2.   Prepare work diskette for filing documents.

          Syntax:

               FORMAT    <Drive>

          Example:

               FORMAT    A:
                      INSTALLATION   ON   HARD   DISK

It is best to install KOWE on hard disk, if one is available.  Hard disk
accessing is much faster than floppy accessing, and can store more
information,

     1.   Make hard disk current drive.

          Syntax:

               <Drive>
          
          Example:
          
               C:

     2.   Create directory to partition KOWE's software and      
          document files from other hard disk contents.

          Syntax:

               MD  <Directory>

          Example:

               MD  \KOWE


     3.   Change to directory created for word processing.

          Syntax:

               CD  <Directory>

          Example:

               CD  \KOWE


     4.   Copy diskette files into hard disk.

          Syntax:

               COPY  <Source Drive>

          Example:

               COPY  A:*.*START    WORD    PROCESSING

To begin wordprocessing, type KOWE at the system prompt.  At the prompt
the source and target can also be specified.  The source file being the
document to retrieve, and target file is the file to save document into.

                        KOWE  <Source File>   <Target File>                 

The manufacturer's logo is displayed when execution starts, and to continue
user only needs to strike a key.  The next screen shows the single and
double line characters, as well the Yoruba characters available, and how to
access them.

The function keys starting from F1 .. F7, are used for all the vowels.  F1
.. F7 alone represents the lower case (Non Capital) - grave vowels, F1 ..
F7 with the shift key represents the upper case (Capital) - grave vowels. 
F1 .. F7 pressed with the control key is for lower case - Acute vowels, and
upper case - Acute vowels are accessed by pressing F1 .. F7 in combination
with the Alternate key.

All the alphabeths and numeric keys work as in other computer applications,
and the control keys continue to perform their normal roles.  The Caps Lock
key is used to toggle between lower and upper case, and the Insert key is
used to select either insert or overwrite mode.  The escape (Esc) key is
used to terminate or end current operation.  The keys and their assignments
are identified below:

          provided in this package provides Yoruba meaning(s) to
          English word and phrases.  Press Alt-F to inform
          computer that you wish to use translator function, next
          enter English word to find its meaning.  The computer
          immediately searches through its memory, if it does not
          find the English word it prints a "Word  Not  Found, 
          Strike  A  Key  To  Continue" message.  If word is
          found, the Yoruba meanings are displayed on the screen,
          and user should strike any key to continue word
          processing.

               TRANSLATE   ENGLISH   DOCUMENT   INTO  YORUBA

          The current document can be converted into its Yoruba's
          meaning.  During translation numbers and symbols retain
          their values, only words are translated.  When KOWE
          identifies a word not in its dictionary, it stores the
          word as it is.  To start translation, press Alt - T,
          and enter document file translation should be stored
          in.  KOWE efficiently and effectively translates the
          document into its Yoruba translation.  However, to access
          translated document, it must be retrieved.


                            DOCUMENT   STORAGE

                                                                            
          To keep a permanent record of wordprocessing documents,
          such work must be saved on diskette or hard disk.  To
          begin saving, press Alt - S, and enter document name.  
          Document name may contain drive and path
          specifications.  Drive name is necessary to save        
          on drive which is not the current one, and path is used
          to specify directory to record information into.  Its
          advisable that document name be of relevance to
          information stored in it.  This will help for later
          referencing, and ease of accessibility at a later
          future.  Document storage will not be successful, if
          target storage media is write protected, or document
          itself is protected.   Storage will also not be
          complete, if free space in storage is not enough.                                                    
                           DOCUMENT   RETRIEVAL

          To recall information stored previously, do the Alt - L 
            combination.   "L" in this case, refers to loading
          document from storage media into computer's memory.  
          The full path specification should be entered, if
          directory to load from is not the current one.   Before
          retrieving document it is suggested, that current work
          be saved if there is need for doing so.  KOWE erases
          current document information, before retrieving from
          disk.   If document is not found on disk, KOWE displays
          an appropiate message, and allows user to continue
          operation.

                            OPERATING   SYSTEM


          To temporarily exist into the operating system, and
          perform system level commands, the "OS" option has been
          provided.  This will transfer operator into the
          operating system environment, and allow him/her do some
          task.  This may be file operations, parameter settings,
          and even execute another software.  After user has
          completed system task, the "EXIT" command may be used
          to return back to word processing.  It is suggested
          that current work be saved, before using this highly
          powerful function.                                      
          

                            DOCUMENT   PRINTING


          To start printing user should press ALT - P
          combination.  Computer will next prompt user on whether
          to send output to printer or file.  This option was
          placed so as to allow user who do not have access to a
          printer, redirect output to a file and print at a later
          time.  The default destination is printer, and this is
          changed by pressing "F" for file.  If output is to be
          sent to file, the computer next request for document
          name to print into.  A printer with DOT MATRIX
          capabilities is required for printing, since graphics
          printing is done.


                          END   WORD  PROCESSING

          After work is completed, and if need be saved, pressing
          Escape (ESC) while in the TEXT mode ends session.
