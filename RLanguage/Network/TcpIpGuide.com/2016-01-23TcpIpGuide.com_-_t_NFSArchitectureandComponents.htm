			NFS Procedures and Operations: The actual functionality of NFS is implemented in the form of procedures and operations that conceptually function at layer seven of the OSI model. These procedures specify particular tasks to be carried out on files over the network, using XDR to represent data and RPC to carry the commands across an internetwork.

			<td>Presentation</td>
			<td>
			External Data Representation (XDR): XDR is a descriptive language that allows data types to be defined in a consistent manner. XDR conceptually resides at the presentation layer; its universal representations allow data to be exchanged using NFS between computers that may use very different internal methods of storing data.

Remote Procedure Call (RPC): RPC is a generic session layer service used to implement client/server internetworking functionality. It extends the notion of a program calling a local procedure on a particular host computer, to the calling of a procedure on a remote device across a network.
