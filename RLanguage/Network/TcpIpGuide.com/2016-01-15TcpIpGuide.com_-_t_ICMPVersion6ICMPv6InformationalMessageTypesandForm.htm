					ICMPv6 Echo Request and Echo Reply Messages
				</a>
			</td>
			<td>
Like ICMPv4, ICMPv6 includes a pair of messages specifically for connection testing. To use them, Device A begins the test process by sending an ICMPv4 Echo Request message to Device B. Device B responds back to Device A with an Echo Reply message. When Device A receives this message, it knows that it is able to communicate (both send and receive) successfully with Device B.

					ICMPv6 Router Advertisement and Router Solicitation Messages
				</a>
			</td>
			<td>
Router discovery in IPv6 works in a very similar manner, by having routers send Router Advertisement messages both on a regular basis and in response to hosts prompting for them using Router Solicitation messages. The router discovery function has been incorporated into the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol, where it is part of a larger class of tools that I call host-router discovery functions.

					ICMPv6 Redirect Messages
				</a>
			</td>
			<td>
When a router receives datagrams destined for certain networks, it may realize that it would be more efficient if such traffic was sent by a host to a different router on the local network. If so, it will invoke the Redirect function by sending an ICMPv6 Redirect message to the device that sent the original datagram. This is the last of the functions that in IPv6 are performed by the Neighbor Discovery protocol, and is explained in a topic on the Redirect function in that section. Redirect messages are always sent unicast to the address of the device that originally sent the datagram that led to the Redirect being created.

					ICMPv6 Router Renumbering Messages
				</a>
			</td>
			<td>
A network administrator uses a device on the internetwork to generate one or more Router Renumbering Command messages. These messages provide a list of prefixes of routers that are to be renumbered. Each router processes these messages to see if the addresses on any of their interfaces match the specified prefixes. If so, they change the matched prefixes to the new ones specified in the message. Additional information is also included in the Router Renumbering Command as appropriate to control how and when the renumbering is done.

If the Command message requests it, each router processing the message will respond with a Router Renumbering Result message. This message serves as feedback to let the originator of the Command know whether the renumbering was successful, and what changes, if any, were made.
