		<tr>
			<td>Flag</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Flag: Indicates the start of a PPP frame. Always has the value "01111110" binary (0x7E hexadecimal, or 126 decimal).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Address</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Address: In HDLC this is the address of the destination of the frame. But in PPP we are dealing with a direct link between two devices, so this field has no real meaning. It is thus always set to "11111111" (0xFF or 255 decimal), which is equivalent to a broadcast (it means "all stations").</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Control</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Control: This field is used in HDLC for various control purposes, but in PPP it is set to "00000011" (3 decimal).
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Protocol</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>Protocol: Identifies the protocol of the datagram encapsulated in the Information field of the frame. See below for more information on the Protocol field.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Information</td>
			<td>Variable</td>
			<td>Information: Zero or more bytes of payload that contains either data or control information, depending on the frame type. For regular PPP data frames the network-layer datagram is encapsulated here. For control frames, the control information fields are placed here instead.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Padding</td>
			<td>Variable</td>
			<td>Padding: In some cases, additional dummy bytes may be added to pad out the size of the PPP frame.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>FCS</td>
			<td>2 (or 4)</td>
			<td>Frame Check Sequence (FCS): A checksum computed over the frame to provide basic protection against errors in transmission. This is a CRC code similar to the one used for other layer two protocol error protection schemes such as the one used in Ethernet. It can be either 16 bits or 32 bits in size (default is 16 bits).

The FCS is calculated over the Address, Control, Protocol, Information and Padding fields.

		<tr>
			<td>Flag</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Flag: Indicates the end of a PPP frame. Always has the value "01111110" binary (0x7E hexadecimal, or 126 decimal).
