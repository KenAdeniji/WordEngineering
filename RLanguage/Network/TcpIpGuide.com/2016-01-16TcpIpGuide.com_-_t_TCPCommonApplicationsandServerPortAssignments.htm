	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>20 and 21</td>
			<td>ftp-data / ftp</td>
			<td>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</td>
			<td>Used to send large files, so ideally suited for TCP.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>23</td>
			<td>telnet</td>
			<td>Telnet Protocol</td>
			<td>Interactive session-based protocol. Requires the connection-based nature of TCP.
			pkgmgr /iu:"TelnetServer"
			PuTTY
			unset ntlm
			set ntlm	
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>25</td>
			<td>smtp</td>
			<td>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</td>
			<td>Uses an exchange of commands, and sends possibly large files between devices. 
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>53</td>
			<td>dns</td>
			<td>Domain Name Server (DNS)</td>
			<td>An example of a protocol that uses both UDP and TCP. For simple requests and replies, DNS uses UDP. For larger messages, especially zone transfers, TCP is used. 
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>70</td>
			<td>gopher</td>
			<td>Gopher</td>
			<td>A messaging protocol that has been largely replaced by the WWW.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>80</td>
			<td>http</td>
			<td>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) World Wide Web</td>
			<td>The classic example of a TCP-based messaging protocol.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>110</td>
			<td>pop3</td>
			<td>Post Office Protocol (POP version 3)</td>
			<td>E-mail message retrieval protocols; use TCP to exchange commands and data.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>119</td>
			<td>nntp</td>
			<td>Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)</td>
			<td>Used for transferring NetNews (USEnet) messages, which can be lengthy.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>139</td>
			<td>netbios-ssn</td>
			<td>NetBIOS Session Service</td>
			<td>A session protocol, clearly better suited to TCP than UDP.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>143</td>
			<td>imap</td>
			<td>Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</td>
			<td>Another e-mail message retrieval protocol</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>179</td>
			<td>bgp</td>
			<td>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</td>
			<td>
While interior routing protocols like RIP and OSPF use either UDP or IP directly, BGP runs over TCP. This allows BGP to assume reliable communication even as it sends data over potentially long distances.			
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>194</td>
			<td>irc</td>
			<td>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</td>
			<td>
IRC is like Telnet in that it is an interactive protocol that is strongly based on the notion of a persistent connection between a client and server.			
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2049</td>
			<td>nfs</td>
			<td>Network File System (NFS)</td>
			<td>
NFS was original implemented using UDP for performance reasons. Given that it is responsible for large transfers of files and UDP is unreliable, this was probably not the best idea, and TCP versions were created. The latest version of NFS uses TCP exclusively.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>6000 - 6063</td>
			<td>tcp</td>
			<td>x11</td>
			<td>Used for the X Window graphical system. Multiple ports are dedicated to allow many sessions.</td>
