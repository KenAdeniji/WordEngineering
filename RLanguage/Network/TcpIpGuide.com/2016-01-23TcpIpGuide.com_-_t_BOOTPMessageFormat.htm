			<td>2</th>
			<td>Seconds: According to RFC 951, the client enters into this field the number of seconds "elapsed since [the] client started trying to boot". This is supposed to provide information to BOOTP servers to help them decide which requests to respond to first.

Unfortunately, this definition was somewhat vague; it wasn't clear if this meant the amount of time since the machine was powered on, or since the first BOOTREQUEST message was sent. In addition, some devices incorrectly implemented this field. As a result, it is not always used. </td>

			In the original BOOTP standard (RFC 951), this was an empty two-

			contains only one flag.<br>
