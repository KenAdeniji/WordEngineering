	DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
	
	There are 4 DNS servers involved in loading a webpage:
	
		DNS recursor - 
			The DNS recursor will receive queries from applications, such as, web browsers that are running on client machines.
			Each DNS query request is passable.
			
		Root nameserver - 
			The root server is the first point, location, for translating host names into IP addresses.

		TLD nameserver - 
			The top level domain server (TLD) stores the last portion of a hostname, for example, .com, org, .gov, .edu.

		Authoritative nameserver -
			This is the final nameserver in which a specific name is translateable into its definition.
			The Authoritative nameserver will return the IP address for the requested hostname to the DNS Recursor 
				that made the initial request.
			Where the query is for a subdomain, for example, KenAdeniji.WordPress.com,
				an additional nameserver will be added to the sequence after the authoritative nameserver,
				which is responsible for storing the subdomain's CNAME record.
