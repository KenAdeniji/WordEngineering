There are value and reference types.
The common language runtime (CLR) is an environment that manages execution of code.
A portable executable (PE) contains metadata along with the code.
The common language specification (CLS) specifies how a language that interacts with the CLR should behave.
Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) is a platform-independent set of instructions that is combined with the metadata to form a file called a portable executable (PE) file, which has an .exe or .dll extension.
A Common language infrastructure (CLI) is an environment suitable for running .NET applications.

Multiple Document Interface (MDI)
	The parent form must have its IsMdiContainer true.
	The menu must set its MDIWindowListItem to the appropriate, window item menu, windowToolStripMenuItem.
	
        private static int childTwoDocumentIndex = 0;

        private void displayChildTwoToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            ++childTwoDocumentIndex;
            FormChildTwo formChildTwo = new FormChildTwo();
            formChildTwo.MdiParent = this;
            formChildTwo.Show();
            formChildTwo.Text = "Child Two Document" + childTwoDocumentIndex.ToString();
        }
MDI - Tiled vertically, tiled horizontally, or cascaded.
Splash screen - To hide the form's title bar, control box, maximize box, minimize box, and text.
	private SplashScreen_FormClosing(object sender, EventArgs e)
	{
		System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5000);
	}
To create a parent, set a form's IsMdiContainer to true.
A child form must be set in code by setting the form's MdiParent property to the parent form.
Designate the window menu by setting the MdiWindowListItem property of the MenuStrip on the parent form.
ErrorProviderObject.SetError(controlName, message);	ErrorProviderObject.Clear();
Enum belongs in a namespace or classlevel, not inside a procedure.
public static bool TryParse(string s, out int result); On error, set result to 0.
Throw ApplicationException. Set the source property.
ActiveX Data Objects (ADO).
Visual Studio generates TableAdapters, when you add a typed DataSet.
A BindingSource object facilitates binding the controls on a Windows Form to the data source.
	The BindingSource keeps all the form's controls displaying data from the same record, called currency.
	Also it handles the navigation, sorting, filtering, and updating of the data.
In the DataSet Designer, right-click the storesTableAdapter and select Configure.
	Click the Advanced Options button, and deselect the check box to Generate Insert, Update abd Delete statements.
Notice the icon, in front of the table. The icon indicates, that the table is set to DataGridView.
	The drop down arrow, at the end allows you, to select different views.
this.employeeTableAdapter.Fill(this.pubsDataSet.employee);
When you double click on the .xsd, you will see the dataset designer.
Convert from grid to details view.
	Delete the grid from the form.
	Click on the down arrow, next to the employee table, in the data sources window, select Details.
To change the default control type, select Tools, Options, Windows Forms Designer, Data UI Customization.
You can change field captions in the DataSet Designer. Click on a field in the DataSet Designer.
	Go to the captions property, in the properties window.
Formatting a bound control is done by selecting the control, scrolling to the properties menu, choose
	(DataBindings) and (Advanced).
Open the DataSet Designer by double clicking the .xsd, or from the DataSources window toolbar, 
	select the DataSet Designer.
Insert a column, and set its expression property.
Sorting the data. Sort with the BindingSource, JobBindingSource.Sort = "JobDesc";
Add the DataBindings.Add() method of each control.
If PubsDataSet.HasChanges(), PubsDataSet.HasChanges(DataRowState.Deleted)
DataSet dataSet = PubsDataSet.GetChanges(); DataSet dataSet = PubsDataSet.GetChanges(DataRowState.Deleted);

dataSet.AcceptChanges(); dataSet.RejectChanges();
To send the changes back to the datasource, execute the TableAdapter's Update method or TableAdapterManager's UpdateAll method.
Edit methods of the BindingSource, AddNew, Insert, CancelNew, CancelEdit, EndEdit, RemoveAt, RemoveCurrent.
Pessimistic concurrency - A row is unavailable to other users, from the time it is received, until its update is complete.
Optimistic concurrency - A row is only unavailable, when an update is being made. If an update has occured, between when the record and an update is attempted, then a currency violation has occured. The default.
Last in wins - A row is only unavailable, when an update is being made. No attempts are made to prevent multiple changes to the same record.
During add or edit, set the combo box's DropDownStyle to simple, afterwards return to DropDownList.

An endpoint indicates where message can be sent (address).
How they will be sent (binding).
