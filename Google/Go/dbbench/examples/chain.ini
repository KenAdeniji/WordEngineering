; SETUP: Before executing this job, run `mkfifo /tmp/dbbench_fifo` to create
; a named pipe.
; 

;
; Once a second for 4 seconds, execute a batch of 4 queries concurrently. Send
; the results of all queries to the named pipe.
;
[pump]
query=select "hello world"

rate=1
count=4
batch-size=4

;
; Run queries as they come in from the named pipe. This will run once for each
; row returned by the "pump" job writing to the named pipe, running 4
; concurrent queries every second for 4 seconds.
;
[query]
query=select ?

; This is a kludge to allow us to execute multiple simultaneous queries; we
; expect to only be running 4 concurrent queries since we will be limited by
; the named pipe, but we allow up to 1000 concurrent queries.
concurrency=1000
