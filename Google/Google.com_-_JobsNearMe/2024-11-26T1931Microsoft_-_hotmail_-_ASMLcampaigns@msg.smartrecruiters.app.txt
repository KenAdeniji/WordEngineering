We recently participated in two major conferences that offered valuable networking opportunities within the engineering world.

From October 24-26, we attended the SWE (Society of Women Engineers) conference in Chicago, themed WE24: Together We Rise—the world's largest gathering for women in engineering and technology.

From October 30 to November 3, we joined the SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers) National Conference in Anaheim, the largest annual event for Hispanic STEM students and professionals.

At both events, ASML ambassadors set up booths to share their experiences and connect with engineers exploring new career opportunities.
