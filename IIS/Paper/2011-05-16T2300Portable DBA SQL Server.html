    <h1>SQL Server Security</h1>

		<h2>SQL Server Security Model</h2>
	
			<h3>Login</h3>
				A login operates at the server level, and it enables an individual user or Windows group
				to connect to SQL Server.
				Beginning from SQL Server 2005, logins are stored in the master.sys.server_principals view.
				For SQL Server 7 and 2000, logins are stored in the master's database sysxlogins table.
				For SQL Server 6.x,  logins are stored in the master's database syslogins table.
			
				CREATE LOGIN [COMFORT\LoginName] 
				FROM WINDOWS WITH DEFAULT_DATABASE=[master], DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=[us_english] 
				GO

				exec sp_addsrvrolemember [COMFORT\LoginName], sysadmin; 
				GO
				
			<h3>User</h3>
				A login requires a complementary user to access the database.
				This user is contained in the sysusers table, or more recently
				in the sys.database_principals.

	<h1>Broken Ownership Chains</h1>
		
		Views in views, held by different owners.
		Avoid by having a single user owns all objects. 
		Grant any user, likely to create objects, a db_owner fixed database role.

	<h1>Full Backup Exclusions</h1>
		
		The operations that are not permitted during full backup, include:
		Adding or modifying indexes in the database.
		Shrinking database and log files.
		Increasing the size of the database.
		Issuing a CREATE or ALTER DATABASE statement.
		Performing non-logged operations.
