    <h1>Domain Name System (DNS)</h1>
    A computer on the Internet has both an IP (Internet Protocol) address, and a fully qualified
    domain name.
    A client, resolver, may request connection to another computer using its host name. The DNS server
    providing the translation, is known as the name server.

    The three main levels that make-up the DNS hierarchy, are:
    
    <ul>
    <li>Root-level domain (represented by a single period)</li>
    <li>Top-level domain (represented by various suffixes, for example, .com, .org)</li>
    <li>Second-level domain (represented by the organization's name, for example, Microsoft)</li>
    </ul>
    
    DNS groups host computer names by domain (or subdomain) into zones.
	
	Prior to installing DNS, ensure that TCP/IP is running, and that the host has a static IP address.

    <h1>DNS Manager</h1>
    The DNS Manager is a graphical tool for managing DNS entries.
    When you start the DNS manager and there is no connected DNS server, it may prompt the user to
    connect to a DNS server.

    <h1>NsLookup.exe</h1>
    The NsLookup.exe is a console application that prints information about the host/domain name.
    If you do not specify a DNS server, the default DNS server is used.

    <h1>DnsCmd.exe</h1>
	A console application for updating the DNS servers.
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	dnscmd [&lt;ServerName&gt;] /enumzones
		(Will lists the zones that exist on the specified DNS server.)
	</li>
	<li>
	dnscmd [&lt;ServerName&gt;] /info [&lt;Setting&gt;]
		(Will lists registry settings at the DNS server level.)
	</li>
	</ul>

    <h1>IPConfig</h1>
	IPConfig /flushdns
	IPConfig /renew
    
	<h1>NetStat</h1>
	NetStat -anb
    
	<h1>Task Manager</h1>
	Performance Tab.
	Resource Monitor.
	
	<h1>Putty</h1>
