Upgrade for continued access to Azure

To keep going with your Azure free account, upgrade now. You’ll get continued access to the services you’re currently using.

When you upgrade, keep building with free amounts of popular services for 12 months, and free amounts of more than 55 other services always. Beyond what’s free, you’ll only pay for the services you use—no upfront costs and no commitment.

How the Azure free account works

    Get popular services free for 12 months, including AI, compute, storage, network, and database (within monthly limits). After 12 months, you can move to pay-as-you-go pricing.
    Continue with always-free services. After 12 months, keep using more than 55 services that are always free and only pay for services you use beyond the free monthly amounts.
