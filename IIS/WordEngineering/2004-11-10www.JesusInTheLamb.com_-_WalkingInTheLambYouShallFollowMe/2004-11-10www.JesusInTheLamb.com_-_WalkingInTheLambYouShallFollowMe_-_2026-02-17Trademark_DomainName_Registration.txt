Subject: Concern Regarding jesusinthelamb To whom it concerns, We are the company who submitted the application to register "jesusinthelamb" as Chinese domain name and internet keyword.
We plan to register the Chinese domain names "jesusinthelamb.cn" "jesusinthelamb.com.cn" "jesusinthelamb.net.cn" "jesusinthelamb.org.cn" and internet keyword "jesusinthelamb" and have submitted our application.
Currently, we are waiting for Mr. Kenny Liu's approval.
These CN domains and internet keyword are very important for us to expand our business in China. 
Even though Mr. Kenny Liu recommended us to choose a different name, we will persist with this name.
Kind regards Lisheng Ning

You
Dear Ken Adeniji,
According to your company that is unrelated to them, we have already advised that they should take a different name to avoid this conflict, but they insist on using this name as their Chinese domain names (jesusinthelamb.cn, jesusinthelamb.com.cn, jesusinthelamb.net.cn, jesusinthelamb.org.cn) and internet keyword. In our opinion, maybe they run similar business as your company and register them to promote their company.
As is generally known, domain name registration in accordance with international rules is open to companies and individuals. Any applicant can request any domain name and internet keyword which remain unregistered. Your company have not registered these Chinese domain names and internet keyword, so any entity have the chance to purchase them by registration. But in order to avoid this kind of conflict, the trademark or original name owner has first rights to register Chinese domain name and internet keyword within our dispute period. If your company is the original owner of this name and wants to register these Chinese domain names (jesusinthelamb.cn, jesusinthelamb.com.cn, jesusinthelamb.net.cn, jesusinthelamb.org.cn) and internet keyword to prevent other people from using them, please contact us. We can forward you an application form with cost details to assist your company to register these Chinese domain names and internet keyword within our dispute period if you want to register them.
I look forward to reading you soon.
Best regards
Kenny Liu

Dear CEO,
We are a Network Service Company which is the domain name registration center in Shanghai, China. On February 11, 2026, we received an an application from Baohui Ltd. They wish to register "jesusinthelamb" as their internet keyword and Chinese domain names (jesusinthelamb.cn, jesusinthelamb.com.cn, jesusinthelamb.net.cn, jesusinthelamb.org.cn). But after we check it, we notice this name conflicts with your company name or brand name. To deal with this matter better, it's necessary to send a message to you and confirm if this company is your distributor in China?
Best regards

Dear Kehinde Adewumi Adeniji,  I hope this message finds you well.
My name is Jonathan Victor, Senior Paralegal Officer in the Federal Trademark & Copyrights Department at Legal Filing Firm.
We have recently received an application from the State of Florida to federally register the business name “Www.jesusinthelamb.com” for trademark protection across all 50 states. 
During our review of the USPTO database, we noted that you were the original applicant for this trademark under serial number 90050770. 
However, the application was marked as abandoned on Apr. 28, 2021.
In accordance with our legal policy, we are reaching out to offer you the first opportunity to reclaim and refile the trademark under your ownership before moving forward with the new applicant.
If we do not receive a response from you promptly, we will be obligated to proceed with the current applicant’s filing, which would grant them exclusive legal rights to the name.
Please be aware that once the trademark is registered to another party, they will have sole ownership and enforcement rights.
This would require you to cease all use of the name “Www.jesusinthelamb.com” in branding, advertising, and business operations. 
The USPTO follows a strict first-to-file policy, and trademark rights are enforceable under The Lanham Act of 1946.
To avoid losing this opportunity, we urge you to respond without delay.
If you wish to reclaim the trademark, please reply to this email, call us at (855) 669-9909, or send a text to confirm your decision. 
We will then connect you with an attorney to begin the refiling process immediately.
Failure to act promptly may result in legal consequences and the permanent loss of rights to the business name.
We look forward to your response.
Best regards, Jonathan Victor 
Senior Paralegal Officer Legal Filing Firm
