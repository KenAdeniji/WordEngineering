I thank you for sharing your idea.

There are three options for the artists to distribute their work:

1. A web link, URL
2. File(s) upload
3. Write a code

The web link is my preference.
File(s) upload may suffer from latency.
Code is useful for the literate.

My user interface (UI) skill is not what I bring to the table.

All is good, as necessary.
