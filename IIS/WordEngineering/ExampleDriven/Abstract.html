		It is our essential idea, that the software and its empowerment for the World Cup and
		Olympics, are one and the same thing.
		The basics of our thought process, is that the first leg of our completion, example driven, 
		where the Olympics learn from the World Cup, is a mere token, to the first half, second half
		model.
		
		Rather than building a software that is similar, we suggests that we build a software that 
		we will use in both competitions.
		
		We haven't taken the time to analyze 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan, but competition set
		and time span are the distinct individualities.
		
		Brazillians are well recognized, as the gods of soccer. Their indepth soccer experience, is a 
		foreshadow to the entirety of sports.
		
		The myopic insight, that we are building software, firstly for the World Cup, and finally
		for the Olympics, should be submerged into the thought that we are mixing both games, into
		a leisure pattern.
		
		What I have learnt from the rest, I have learnt from the beginning.
		
		I have learnt from the glory of the rest.
		
		We have built in series, in a perfecting mode.
		
		Please allow me to say, that the advances in software, between both games, will be 
		integrated into the later game, and will serve as the basis for later competitions.
		
		As a reflection of our passage, we can learn from the rest.
		The reflection of the glory past, is the precedence, for our journey.
		A continual usage of our passage time.
