During my interview this morning, I have a better understanding of my prospective employer's requirement.

The business application include:
	Camp Class Manager, Esteem Network.
	Volunteer.
	File Maker Pro.
	
Lessons Learnt:
	I have learnt to listen intently, prior to attributing blame.
	With data cleansing, I implore us to know the source of bad data? Who is inputting the data?
		Does the vendor have data definition language (DDL) to pre-empt data corruption?
			Data type and size: String, number, date, logic boolean?
			Not nullable? Can not be empty?
			Range check: Visiting fee must be greater than zero? Date must exceed the zoo's opening date.
			Check constraints, for schedule, dated from must precede dated until.
			Primary and foreign keys with unique indexes help to ascertain data.
			Default columns are probable system generated that the users may leave unfilled that are available from sequence, identity, system clock.
		Is the source of error our employees or on-line users?
		Is the data incomplete, such as abbreviation, for example CA or California, telephone numbers without country or area code?
		Is it data manipulation language (DML) deadlock, arrangement of data modification?
		Steps to correction, schedule outside business hours, take backup?
	I will ask SFZoo to investigate, and if need be, migrate?
	There can be no use without determination.
	To a modern style? There is ours.
	To attitude to know.
