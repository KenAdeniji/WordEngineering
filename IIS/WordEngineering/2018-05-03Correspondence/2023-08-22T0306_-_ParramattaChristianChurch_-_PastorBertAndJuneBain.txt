I spoke to Suzan Griffith and I asked to speak to the senior pastor, Hilary Williams.
Suzan Griffith said the senior pastor, Hilary Williams, is not available at the moment.
I left my contact details, both my telephone number and e-mail address.
I will expect to communicate with the Filipino Hilario and South African Portuguese Jorge and Michael Rodriguez.
