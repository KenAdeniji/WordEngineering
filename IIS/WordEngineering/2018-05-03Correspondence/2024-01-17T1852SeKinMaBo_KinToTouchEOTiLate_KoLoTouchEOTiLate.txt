What our being the same means to each other?
The words I have spoken, who is it intended for?
The life I have chosen, who is receptive?
The words I hear, who speaks them?
There must be no parting as each other?

Allowing the God. the possibility?
What are His intention, how do I realize it?
With God the distance are never forever.
We have people of our own, where is our sojourn?
I am not entirely my past...as I am the present.

I want you as part of me...not elsewhere.
In one location...there are many others.
Where does chance...be fully ours?
What do I bring...as time chosen along?
This I am, is where I want you.

We are people, where do you bring along?
There must be completely me...without you?
I can make love...who to?
What do you want as you...living in me?
This many of you...is how I have realized.

The experience of choosing people...as ours.
This time must be spent in rewarding many?
With all love...there are good.
Providing the same as myself.
There is necessary a place...as the future.

Choosing as the presence of life...is choosing how you realize life.
