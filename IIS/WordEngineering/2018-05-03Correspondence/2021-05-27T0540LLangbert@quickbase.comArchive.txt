How are we modelable alike?

Can I repeat my earlier success with AlphabetSequence?

If I can trace, what led to AlphabetSequence; can others benefit from my goal?

What I was doing, when the idea for AlphabetSequence, came up, may lead others to similar gain.

What is historically available; is historical presence.

In Australia, in my mid-20's, I started and completed my Master's degree, and became a Doctorate candidate.

I was given the opportunity to become technically adept.

This is what interested me, when I started AlphabetSequence; I was open to the intervention of God.

This led to other uses; but the earliest notion, was how God, uses His own.

What does He, want you to do; as a person involve with Him?

What programmatic; our nature?

It is not, how you use Him? Who uses Him?

With my completed of mine; this is yours.
