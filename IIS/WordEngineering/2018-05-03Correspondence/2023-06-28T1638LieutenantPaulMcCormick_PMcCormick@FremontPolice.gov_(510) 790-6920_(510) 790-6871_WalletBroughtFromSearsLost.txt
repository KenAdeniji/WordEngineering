Good Morning Ken;

Thank you for the email.  However, because you last saw your wallet in Union City, you will need to contact the Union City Police Department and file a report with that agency.  Below is the link to the Union City Police Department.  You can file a report on line or in person.  Best of luck to you.  Paul
