Important information about your Citi Gold Credit Card account ending 8521

Dear Kehinde

We would like to let you know that we will no longer offer the Citi Gold Credit Card from 30 September 2024. As a
result, your card will change to the Citi Rewards Mastercard.

Please note:

If we have previously cancelled or suspended your right to spend on your Citi Gold Credit Card and
participate in the Citi Rewards Program, this will not change.

You will start to notice your card name change to 'Citi Rewards Credit Card' on all communications you
receive from us including monthly statements, emails, and letters.

Your current 'Credit Card Terms and Conditions and Other Important Information' and 'Terms and
Conditions of the Citi Rewards Program' will continue to apply to your account and can be found at
citibank.com.au/credit-cards/terms.

It's important that you read this notice carefully. You should also keep a copy for your records.
