Scene 1: 
I am working in a place as the lead software engineer.
My naive manager bought metrics measurement limits rules engine software for me.
The software was delivered on five 5 1/4 floppy diskettes.
I, in software piracy violation, attempted to make a personal home copy for use on three 3 1/2 disks.

Scene 2: 
Inside the house of Uncle Demola in the south-east, I picked up green leaves inside the lid cover of an open computer, mainly in its south-east.
