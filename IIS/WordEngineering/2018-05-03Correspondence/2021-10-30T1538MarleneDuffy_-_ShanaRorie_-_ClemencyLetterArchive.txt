Clemency Letter

Great morning Governor Cooper,

Praying you are doing great and having a great Week.

My name is Marlene Duffy and I am Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji ex-girlfriend ,

I had dated Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji for over 20 Years and I have witnessed Miss Shana Rorie continuously abuse the system by always locking Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji up every time she knew he was with me.

Their was a time I had gone to pick up Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji from Mecklenburg County considering the fact that he was getting released from Jail after being locked up due to Miss Shana Rorie’s allegation against him only to realize the fact that Miss Shana Rorie had had Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji up the same day he had just been let out of Jail .

Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji is a good man and I had never witnessed any Domestic Violent attitude from him in over 19Years I have known him .

I do also remember a Bond Officer Mr. Celestial Good (704 )596-7776 , I had introduced to Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji getting tired of often taking money from Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji when profusely bailing him out that the Bond Officer Mr. Celestial Good chose to go to Court on Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji’s behalf to speak with the Judge to please let Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji sign himself out because Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji and I had spent the Weekend at the Bonds Officer Mr. Celestial Goods home with his family at the time Miss Shana Rorie had accused Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji wrongfully of him violating the Restraining Order against him.

Miss Shana Rorie even went as far as stealing Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji’s Saint Bernard dog and locked Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji up out of spite.

My reason for pleading with you to please grant Mr. Oscar Adedayo Adeniji the Clemency is because he really does truly deserve the Clemency and he is a great Man to me and my family.
