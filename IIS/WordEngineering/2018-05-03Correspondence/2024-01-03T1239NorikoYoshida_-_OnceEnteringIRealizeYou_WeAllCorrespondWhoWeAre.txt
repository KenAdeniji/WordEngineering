Once entering...I realize you.
We all correspond...Who we are.
To need...as participation.
With often where we are...where we seem at peace.
One another...that is so much, forever.

With penetration...there are desire.
To have found...I started new.
Pretending life...is finally expanding.
When does God put...to address.
I have always believe, word, sight...to keep the distance, these are no forever.

With world...there are no comparison, if we are found.
With LORD...these time, there are sufficiency.
These far I carry, with no dropping.
We need one another...these I found out.
With love...we are supposedly new.

Only God bring...Only God will not remove you.
God create the distance, the separation.
There is a reason, why we are? These is a reason, why we are not?
He started...here are my correspondence.
Our future are certain...here we are present.

What matters to me...is where I bring love.
What is much of me...is where my forever seek.
I must express...as I.
We are so far remove from a place...our work gather the same.
Will gather matter as the same?

Where can I put His will...behind the cost?
When God puts a thought...I build the relation.
What remains of me...is where I provide, ahead.
God starts, I finalize.
Living in our relation...is not permanently at new.

Whose place are you taking? Whose sorrow are you bearing?
Where does the similar...last?
