In the south-west, Aunt Sadie, another man, and I are inside a room. The man asked me to go outside and check for a red car which would signify the abomination of desolation. I went outside and parked in the parking lot of the house to the east was a red car. There were other cars parked in the parking lot, and on the street, east. I walked back inside the house, westward. There were 2 young females, including 1 female that I found sassy, an additional person, with an adult man whom I walked with. I wanted to warn Aunt Sadie and the other members that an unknown man, a non-associate, was coming in. In the south-west room, there were no more active people, and there may be passive people. I saw garments for sleeping on the couch in the west, but no one was awake. 07:27 microsoft windows operating system, microsoft sql server management studio grid falls, drops, ejects, fails.
