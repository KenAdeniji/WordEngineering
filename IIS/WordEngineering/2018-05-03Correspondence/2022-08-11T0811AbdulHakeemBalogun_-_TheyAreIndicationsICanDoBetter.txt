They are indications. I can do better.

The steps mentioned below are my suggestions to Sofia:

Since Sofia wants to pursue a Masters degree in Computer Science
to further her education and career advancement,
I believe she should start learning programming at home and enroll in a program.
The Internet offers an opportunity.
In 1999, when I re-located to the United States of America (USA),
I started as a database administrator (DBA).
Afterwards I studied web programming using HyperText Markup Language (HTML),
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and JavaScript.
Today, mobile telephones and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are rewarding.

On the Internet, I have found the following sites valuable:

http://Indeed.com for jobs.
http://WordPress.com for web publishing.
http://CraigsList.org for locally advertised jobs.

On two non-consequetive terms, I have enrolled at Ohlone College, for computer training.

Sofia should contact institutions that offer Masters or Doctorate degrees by research work
as opposed to course work. This will let Sofia to immediately start her program 
prior to costly admission.

When I started my Doctorate in Australia, I was advised to continue my current profession,
and not separate it from my studies.
So Sofia should find out, that computer is a tool for her interest.

For job search, I used to be attached to the Employment Development Department (EDD).

Sofia should discuss her interest with a local mosque:
	Islamic Society of East Bay (ISEB). 
		33330 Peace Terrace. Fremont, California (CA) 94555.
		mailto:iseb_info@yahoo.com
		http://iseb.org
		
	Abu Bakr Siddiq Mosque. Afghan Refugee Islamic Community.
		29414 Mission Boulevard. Hayward, California (CA) 95444.
			Within walkable distance from South Hayward BART Station.
		Telephone Number: (510) 582-2730

	What hope I have to fulfill (Luke 24:13-53)?
