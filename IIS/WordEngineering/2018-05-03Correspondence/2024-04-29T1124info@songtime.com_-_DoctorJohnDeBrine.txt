I used to be a listener of yours on Songtime USA cassettes.
I look forward to receiving these periodic recordings of Christian sermons and music.
I had just re-located to the United States of America and I drove to work and church.
This gift kept me company.
I am a Nigerian-born Australian citizen, and I associated with E.V. Hill.
My favorite recordings are:
    Decision Determines Destiny
     A Biblical Look at Death and Dying (SM-150)
        "Dr. James Andrews came to faith on 1950-01-15. Dr. John DeBrine's birthday."

I thank you for introducing me to:

On 2002-09-30 I dreamed of you penetrating my asshole with your penis (Hebrews 6:19, 1 Kings 8:49).

2024-05-08T16:46:00 I was looking and I found him.
	In 1998, I specifically searched for prophecy on the Internet and I found KHouse.org.
	I received SongTime via snail mail.
	In Australia, I was not exposed to the great divide between Jews and Gentiles.
	In hindsight, SongTime was a rebound to claim unity between Jews and African descendants, like, for example, the Ethiopian eunuch.
	On the Internet, I could browse and explore further the teachings of Chuck Missler and I could start my week listening to his weekly Bible teaching.
	Chuck Missler affirmed Bible Code and Ivan Panin which may have laid the foundation for AlphabetSequence. 
	Doctor John DeBrine leaned towards music, backlash Francis Chukwuma Okwechime; 
	Israel antisemitism Reel.com David Dolan; 
	authority of Chuck Missler Ford Motor Company, BlueLetterBible, Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel; 
	khouse.org searchable web presence; 
	Nancy Missler of The King's High Way Ministries, Faith in the Night Seasons, and later Koinonia University was a critic and prodigy recruitment of my doctorate candidacy.
