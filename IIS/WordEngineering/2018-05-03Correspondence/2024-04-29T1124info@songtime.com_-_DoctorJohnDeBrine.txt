I used to be a listener of yours on Songtime USA cassettes.
I look forward to receiving these periodic recordings of Christian sermons and music.
I had just re-located to the United States of America and I drove to work and church.
This gift kept me company.
I am a Nigerian-born Australian citizen, and I associated with E.V. Hill.
My favorite recordings are:
    Decision Determines Destiny
     A Biblical Look at Death and Dying (SM-150)
        "Dr. James Andrews came to faith on 1950-01-15. Dr. John DeBrine's birthday."

I thank you for introducing me to:

On 2002-09-30 I dreamed of you penetrating my asshole with your penis (Hebrews 6:19, 1 Kings 8:49).
