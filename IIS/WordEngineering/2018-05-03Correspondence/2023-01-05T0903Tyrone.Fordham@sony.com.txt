In my last 3 roles, I have concentrated and focused on the
Microsoft C# and ASP.Net on the front-end and application
logic programming. I also have experience using SQL-CLR.

As part of my doctorate candidacy, I used the C
language to program smart cards. 
I have 35 years of experience with the C language.

I have Ohlone Community College education in both C# and C++.

At International Gaming Technology (IGT) and Reel.com
SQL Server database administration was my speciality and
core-strength.

During the last 17-years I am decisive in using JavaScript
when there is no database integration.
