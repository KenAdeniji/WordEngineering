Our previous generation, the eldest member, Adesegun Oluwole Adeniji, is observing a Moslem eating and drinking celebration, probably because it is a holy day in Islam. I do not plan to eat at the place of Uncle Segun in the north-west because of contaminated milk or water. My twin sibling said 4 generations ago he met a set of singing sisters who probably have the surname Sheard, and they are probably called Sheard Sisters. I corrected my twin sibling that 4 generations means 4 * 40 Biblical years, so my twin sibling asserted at the beginning 4 generations ago, 3 * 40 Biblical years.

Our paternal grand father name you Adedotun, and your younger male sibling Adedokun Dotun and Dokun are 5 letters. Adedotun and Adedokun are 8 letters. What has worked for me, is not specialize on software engineering, nor Biblical interpretation 15:22 but to use 15:23 the word God has giving me. 15:23 I try to be creative with the word. To start the day, I record the word. 15:24 To continue the day, I meditate on the word. 2025-06-30T11:15:00...2025-06-30T11:19:00

Pastor Adedotun Arifalo née Adeniji (PD),

What is your telephone number in the United Kingdom (UK) +44?

Can I still telephone you on your Nigerian telephone number +234 (802) 491-6949?

15:31 Explain to Mofe how to be pastor. People are not asking you to preach to them. Nick the Greek. People are asking you 15:32 to make effect... of the Word of God.
