2021-01-05T13:37:00 ... 2021-01-05T13:43:00 I called biological mother and informed her.
 
2021-01-05T13:12:00 ... 2021-01-05T13:25:00

When I came back from my walk, I found out that the front door was locked, two Hindi guys were on the street and one of them came to the front door. The door is normally not locked.

I later went to twin sibling's room, and I asked him, when you want me to move out, let me know?

Twin sibling responded, you should move out, when you want to; you can fucking move out, today.

Please help me find a sanctuary country?

Thank you and God blesses.

Daddy:-

I think you and Kenny need to talk.

He just came to my bedroom to tell me that he will not be speaking to Dr. Obrien.

Thanks

Good Morning,

Yes I can but I will need to speak to Kenny.  He is scheduled for a treatment plan update.  I will call Thursday, January 28, 2021 at 10:00  am to review with him. Today, Medication will be sent to CVS Pharmacy at Fremont Hub for a one month supply.   After our meeting we will add refills at that time.  Please ask him to be available.
