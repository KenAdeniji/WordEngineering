Yesterday, I telephoned Pankaj Joshi, and Harshit Tewara answered the telephone.

Harshit Tewari questioned if I have been working for Ephraim Tech, since 2000?

Harshit Tewari said Pankaj Joshi would return my telephone call this morning.

	The following season was a low point for the Rockets during Olajuwon's tenure.
	They finished 42–40,[23] and missed the playoffs for the first time in Olajuwon's career. He missed two weeks early in the season due to an accelerated heartbeat.[32]
	Despite his usual strong numbers, he could not lift his team out of mediocrity.
	Since making the Finals in 1986, the Rockets had made the playoffs five times, but their record in those playoff series was 1–5 and they were eliminated in the first round four times. 

	Following the season, Olajuwon requested a trade in part because of his bad contract; his salary was considerably low for a top center, and his contract specifically forbade re-negotiation.[33]
	He also expressed displeasure with the organization's efforts to surround him with quality players. 
	He felt the Rockets had cut corners at every turn, and were more concerned with the bottom line than winning.[34] 
	Management had also infuriated Olajuwon during the season when they accused him of faking a hamstring injury because of his unhappiness over his contract situation.[35]
	His agent cited his differences with the organization as being "irreconcilable",[36] and Olajuwon publicly insulted owner Charlie Thomas and the team's front office.[33][37] 
	With the 1992–93 season approaching, a reporter for the Houston Chronicle said that Olajuwon being dealt was "as close to a sure thing as there is."[38]
