Razi Syed, the father of Naina eyes

I thank you for driving me home.

2024-05-15T22:26:00 Hopefully, it is in season...with you.

I enjoyed my interaction with Naina.

I was unhappy with Naina not being as tall as expected.

2024-05-15T22:28:00 Tajudeen Afolabi Adeola a co-founder and 1st managing director of Guaranty Trust Bank in Nigeria wished I grow.

Although I am Christian, I have Moslem family members and friends.

2024-05-15T22:32:00 When we forever see, as much as we have.

As your profession is in sales and you are a Moslem, what is your expectation of me?

2024-05-15T22:37:00 Where my effort...gather?

2024-05-15T22:30:00 What improvement...we have of one another? Sitting on a chair, facing North, left thigh, scratches.

2024-05-15T22:43:00 Hopefully, Sandhill and Naina are still together?

2024-05-15T22:44:00 I have always hope...time will enlighten.

2024-05-15T22:46:00 As much as poss...where my reason...are place?

2024-05-15T22:47:00 Having reached doctorate candidacy in Internet Commerce, and worked in the software industry...2024-05-15T22:49:00 I will like to apply myself...God's life?

2024-05-15T22:50:00 What does He want to say...in my life?

2024-05-15T22:51:00 People will like to find me valuable?

2024-05-15T22:52:00 I will like to be prophetic...relevant.

2024-05-15T22:53:00 Finding my story...as part of time?

2017-06-03 My cousin's family shared Hindi catering among the food served.

2024-05-15T22:57:00 When has he spoken...when have I listened?

2024-05-15T22:59:00 What will our life bring...that make us similar?

2024-05-15T23:00:00 I don't see growth as the same...as normal as human being.

For my 3 Associates degree and Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering, I only did 1 oral communication course. My native language Yoruba is not my fluency.

2024-05-15T23:06:00 What have we learnt...as English departed?

2024-05-15T23:10:00 What exactly have we chosen (Genesis 39:8, Daniel 1:8)?
