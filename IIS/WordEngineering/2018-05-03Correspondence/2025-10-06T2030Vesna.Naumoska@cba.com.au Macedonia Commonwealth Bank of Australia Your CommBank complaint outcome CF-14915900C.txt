You​

Dear,

I am writing to you about your complaint you made with us on 06/10/2025 regarding increasing your international money transfer limit.

Thank you for getting in touch and letting us know about your concerns taking the time to provide us with your feedback.

I sincerely apologise that this has caused you inconvenience.

Below is a brief summary of the issues in the matter I have investigated:

    You requested to increase the international money transfer limit to enable a transfer using your security questions. 
    You advised that you are currently overseas and do not have a mobile number owned by yourself to enable Netcode SMS registration.
    You advised that you do not want to list a mobile number and be registered for Netcode SMS due to the scam calls you receive. 
    You expressed dissatisfaction that we cannot review the international money transfer limit whilst on security questions. 

The outcome of my investigation:

    Due to our internal security processes we may in some cases decline to increase your daily transfer limit or refer you to attend a branch to discuss the matter in person. It is important to note, increasing your limit may also increase your unauthorised transactions and do not recommend having your limit increased for an extended period of time. 
    Additionally we may in our discretion remove or reduce your access to transfers and/or payments to third parties or non-linked accounts, including PayID, BPAY payments, and/or International Money Transfers.

You have the following options: 

In order to review your international money transfer limits with our Commbank Safe specialist team you would need to be eligible for one of the following:

    Register for Netcode SMS security or 
    Order a Netcode Token. 

I have submitted your request for a Netcode Token today. The netcode token can take up to 10 business days for international delivery from the time the order is processed and sent overseas. The delivery timeframes may be impacted by Australia Post factors. 

When you receive the Netcode Token, please contact us on 132221 to hold a discussion with our Commbank Safe specialist team. When calling from overseas using your mobile, standard roaming charges may apply. To avoid roaming charges, call the international operator in the country you’re in from a land line and provide them our reverse charges number +61 2 9999 3283.

 

What happens next  

There is nothing further you need to do. However, it’s important to contact us immediately if:  

you're concerned that you may have fallen victim to a scam and you've sent money or authorised a transaction as a result of the possible scam event; or 

you're worried that you've been contacted by a scammer and you've provided them your identity information or banking details.
