Hello,

My apologies, the phone number I was calling was an Australian number and was not the number listed below.

Are you wanting to add a card to your account or to apply for a credit card?

 

Thank you

I need a VISA card for making payments.

Therefore, an ATM or EFTPOS card will suffice.

Thank you, and God blesses.
