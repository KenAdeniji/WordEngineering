I wish to transfer USD2000 to the account details below:

Account Number: 1950-7746
Bank Name: Citibank NA New York

Shanae Hajsinger promised Shai Dodds will call me immediately.
Shanae Hajsinger promised if Shai Dodds could not call me immediately; Shanae Hajsinger will get someone else to call me.
On numerous occasions I asked for Shai Dodds contact details, but Shanae Hajsinger would not give the information.
I left home at 2023-11-15T15:05:00, I had waited 30 minutes, half an hour, for a call from Shai Dodds or someone else from Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
Shai Dodds called but she did not leave her contact information.
I called Shai Dodds on the caller ID, 61-2-7907-4495, and I could not leave a voice mail, since the message box is full.
I called Shanae Hajsinger on 61-2-8388-3795 and I left a voice mail.
