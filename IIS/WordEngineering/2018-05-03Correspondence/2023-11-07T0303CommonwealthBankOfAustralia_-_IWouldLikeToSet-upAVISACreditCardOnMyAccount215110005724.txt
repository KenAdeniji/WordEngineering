Thank you for copying in Matt Comyn to your latest email, I understand that you wish the bank to take your email as an authority to issue a VISA Credit Card.

I understand from the previous correspondence that staff have been unable to contact you, as you are overseas.

I am responding on the bank’s behalf, I understand that a written response may be best at this stage.

We are unable to comply with your request of lodging an application via an email , nor can simply approve a Credit Card account in your sole name, via an email request.

When a customer applies for a credit facility we have to complete an assessment to ensure that they meet the responsible lending guidelines and the bank’s confidential credit policy. This is for any application completed whether it is for a new or existing customer.

The lending criteria takes into consideration many things, including factors like applicants income, liabilities, living expenses, their account conduct on all accounts etc. The bank must check that any applications for finance are assessed in accordance with our confidential credit criteria. This is to ensure we meet our obligations under the Code of Banking Practice, other legislation and our internal policies.

You can apply for a credit card via your NetBank or I can arrange for a lending specialist to contact you at a time that suits you. Please let me know if I can assist with this requirement.

Please understand that we cannot waive or influence in any way policy, requirements or a credit decision.

Additional support

Support is available when you need it. You can find support options at https://www.commbank.com.au/credit-cards.html?ei=anch_cc. Please review for options - Whether you’re looking for a credit card with no monthly or international transaction fees, travel insurance or the ability to earn rewards, compare our range of cards to find the best credit card for your needs. Apply for a credit card online and get a response in 60 seconds.

Dear Mr Adewumi

 

Thank you for your message, unfortunately I am in all day meetings. I note that a request has been lodged for you to be contacted by our security team, to review your identification.

 

Keeping your accounts safe and protecting you from fraud is our priority, which is why we want to make sure your information is up to date and accurate, we’ll reach out from time to time to confirm your personal and/or business details.

 

We need to update your personal details with us whenever they change. We’ll also need to confirm your personal information from time to time as part of our ongoing regulatory obligations to ensure your details are complete, current and accurate.

 

Maintaining current identification details helps us play an important role in detecting, deterring and disrupting financial crime. You'll see us refer to this as our ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006.

 

We are required to manage your account/s in line with the Anti-Money Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act 2006, which sets out that all banks operating within Australia are required to collect, verify and maintain customer identification information.

 

In the same way that we need to comply with regulations when you first open an account, we also need to comply with current law regarding the maintenance of your customer identification information. We ask this information for two main reasons:

·        To ensure that the information we hold on file for you is correct and up to date. This helps us to identify and stop any unusual activity that may occur on your account as soon as possible.

·        To ensure that we're acting in accordance with our obligations set out by our regulators

 

All financial institutions operating within Australia are required to collect and maintain this information.

Even if details haven’t changed, it's important to confirm them when we ask you to, otherwise we may need to restrict access to your banking until you do confirm them.

 

Once the identification has been reviewed and confirmed then access to your facilities will be reinstated.

 

As advised please note that we do not have any delegation to override or waive a policy or regulatory requirement.

 

Kind regards

 

Alex
