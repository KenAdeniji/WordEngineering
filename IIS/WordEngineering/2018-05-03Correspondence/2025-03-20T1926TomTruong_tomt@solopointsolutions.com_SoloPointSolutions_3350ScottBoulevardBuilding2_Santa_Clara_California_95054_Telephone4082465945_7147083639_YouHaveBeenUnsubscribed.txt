Hi Ken,
For Employees:
ENGINEER YOUR EDGE IN A COMPETITIVE JOB MARKET
While the tech sector continues to drive job growth in 49 states, led by California and Illinois, engineering openings have dropped 26%, and manufacturing fell 16.9% year-over-year.

With fewer opportunities and increased competition, engineers must differentiate themselves to grab hiring managers' attention.

Here are some steps engineers can take to stand out in a competitive job market...
	
For Employers:
RESILIENT WORKFORCE: STABILITY AMID ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY
The U.S. job market showed strong growth in February despite trade policy uncertainties and federal spending cuts. While unemployment ticked up in key manufacturing regions, it remains low.
