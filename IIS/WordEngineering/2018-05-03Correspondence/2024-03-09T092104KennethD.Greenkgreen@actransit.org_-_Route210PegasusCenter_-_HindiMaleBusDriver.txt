2024-04-26T21:04:00 Today, I had another encouraged...encounter.

2024-04-26T14:05:00 The same Hindi bus driver at the intersection of Alvarado Boulevard and Dyer Street, Union City, stop ID 54323.
    The Hindi bus driver said, I asked him not to board.
    The Hindi bus driver said, I should not pay the fare, but I paid.
    The Hindi bus driver and the passengers got off the bus, and he telephoned, and the receiver asked, why are you screaming?
   
2024-04-26T14:26:00 The Hindi bus driver gave 3 AC Transit bus vouchers to an Indian Moslem mother and daughter and a male, and he drove the empty bus away.
    8 passengers waited on the next AC Transit route 210 bus departing from Union Landing and finally arriving at Ohlone College.

AC Transit route 210 bus.
Pegasus Center, Fremont Boulevard and Enea Court.
Hindi bus driver.
I politely asked the bus driver to ride to the next bus stop.
The bus driver asked me not ask for a favor, again. 
I said, I spoke to him politely and that he is being rude. 
He asked me to get off the bus.
He confronted me and called law enforcement. 
To avoid trespass charges I got off and vacated the bus.
