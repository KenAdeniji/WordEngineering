AC Transit route 210 bus.
Pegasus Center, Fremont Boulevard and Enea Court.
Hindi bus driver.
I politely asked the bus driver to ride to the next bus stop.
The bus driver asked me not ask for a favor, again. 
I said, I spoke to him politely and that he is being rude. 
He asked me to get off the bus.
He confronted me and called law enforcement. 
To avoid trespass charges I got off and vacated the bus.
