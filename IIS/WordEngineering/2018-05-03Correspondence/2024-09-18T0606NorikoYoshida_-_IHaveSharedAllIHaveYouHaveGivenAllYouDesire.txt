I have shared all I have... you have given all you desire.
All I have chosen out of life... is all I seem in you.
Perhaps trying as life... is trying as the beginning.
A man... a woman... there is life after.
To who love is kind... to who love has given.

I keep trying to see where you began... you keep trying to see where we meet.
You decided one brings you... you decided one chooses you.
My history... is a brief moment... shared with you.
Can we be closest, as never finishing?
What you choose of me... is what I said I meant.

Our life changing matters?
If you are not after... where are you ahead?
Do I choose a companion as life... do I choose a companion as death?
I have shared my moment with you... that you may share your life with me.
The world may never seem as you... but I seem the world in you.

This world ahead... is never shared apart.
This time we have shared... is never lived again.
This luxury... is only our seclusion.
I have tried life... now, life matters to me.
Could you be someone else... I won't be part of the same?

What I bring is my history... what you bring is your forwarding.
You understood... where life falls apart... is where I am not ahead.
I understood the creation as the beginning... and there no choosing love after.
When love is spared life... love hasn't began.
What time matters... is how we spent it.

You have the love... where the man matters.
A man created... is a man created for meeting the moment.
The love shared are never ending... the time shared are never pending.
The dream... must occasion the man.
I have chosen to live ahead as myself... you have chosen to live ahead as one of us.
