		<h1>2019-12-17 Your Part of the History</h1>

		<h2>Oral Sex with Professor Foley</h2>
		<p>
			Professor Foley and I, met at a bus stop in Charlotte.
			I had gotten up, so an older female Caucasian, could sit down.
			Professor Foley said that I was respectful to this female,
			and he invited me to his house, the forth-coming weekend.
			When I visited his house, he served me sandwich, and he
			showed me pictures of bulky African descent males, foreigners
			that he met abroad, while visiting.
			He said, there is nothing wrong with these males.
			We went to his bedroom, and he gave me blow job.
			I did not want to be with him, but I feared for my life,
			if I tried to run away.
			He asked me, to come back the following weekend,
			to practice other acts.
			As I was going back home, the sole of my shoes, fell apart, one shoe.

		<h2>4201 Carlye Drive. Charlotte, North Carolina (NC) 28208. Incest with Tokunbo and Remi</h2>
		<p>
			On several occasions, I visited home, to grind Tokunbo and Remi.
			Biological father was in Africa, and my stepmother, Eula Pearl, was at work.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Gbagada, Lagos State, Nigeria. Incest with Dotun, Tutu and Titi</h2>
		<p>
			On several occasions, I grinded Dotun, Tutu and Titi, in the mornings.
			All of us, slept in the master bedroom.
			The final time, Titi and I, went downstairs, and she said, Fi si,
			meaning insert it in, but I did not have penetration with
			any of my younger ones.
			While working at Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) I gave money
			to Dotun, Buki and Tutu; but I later realized,
			this money should have been given to father figure, as financial support.

		<h2>1996-02-14 Electronic Data Systems (EDS) at Westpac</h2>
		<p>
			EDS terminated our contract on 1996-02-14, Valentine day;
			Mark Boelens said that I am a fraud; and if I was any good 
			a consultant, I should be able to get another contract.
			At Employment Development Department, 1 Oxford Street;
			I exemplified, but I could not charge, for unworked hours.
			I accussed racism, and I identified a friendly Greek male, 
			for the sake of money.
			One day, God said, asked,
			Do you not believe, I will provide your need?
		</p>

		<h2>Francis Okwechime, Bavarian Motor Works (BMW), 3D World Magazine</h2>
		<p>
			One day, a Saturday or Sunday, a weekend day;
			Francis and Patrick Okwechime, and Michael Adeshina
			and I, went to Canterbury to purchase a BMW.
			When I lived in Campsie, I could commute by public transport,
			train and bus.
			I paid $2,000 Australian Dollars (AUD) to arrange for
			a fraudulent car insurance claim.
			Francis Okwechime asked me to pay for his advertisement
			on 3D World Magazine.
			I later claimed that I made no purchase from 3D World Magazine.
			Nonrepudiation.

			When written of God.
