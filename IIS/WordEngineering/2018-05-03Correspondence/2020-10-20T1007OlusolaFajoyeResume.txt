Please take the following steps:

Convert your resume from the propriety Microsoft Word document format
to the open source HTML format; 
if you are using the Microsoft Word software to edit the document,
use the File Save As menu command.

I will suggest placing your resume on the Internet, World Wide Web,
the downside is that you might receive spam e-mails and 
harassment telephone calls.

Consider prefixing your telephone number(s) with the Nigeria's telephone
country area code, +234. For example, +2348181388025.

Your e-mail address excludes Olu, as olusolaadeniji82@gmail.com

Your career objective is wordy and not understandable. 
The career objective should be, what you want to do, the role you want
to perform for your employer.

After your career objective, add your achievement,
followed by your work history and education.

I don't see any place for your Bio Data in a non-discriminatory work place.

Consider visiting the web sites below, on how-to write your resume?

	http://www.resume.com

Find job/employment web-sites, that cater for the Nigeria market.

Go to http://www.google.com and search for:
	employment Nigeria
	
I have had to make the transition from being a job-seeker,
to being a soho contributor.

Trying to be some, as others.
What makes you, above others?
To separate ourself, as our rest.
