2024-07-23T19:48:00 Promise Hill was parked in front of the Wienerschnitzel drive-thru window.
I asked Promise Hill if it was okay to ride home with her, and she confirmed yes.
So I got inside Promise Hill's car.
One of your lookalike male employees spoke rudely to me.
I do not know his name, but I can identify him.
This is not the 1st occasion that I will interact with him; therefore, 2024-07-24T02:50:00 it was uncalled for.

2024-07-24T12:35:00 Juan Ortega is the name of the male employee, and the telephone number of the restaurant is (510) 792-9618.
2024-07-24T18:49:00	Pedro Ortega collaborated that Promise Hill said I am her neighbor.

	I heard falsehood from class associates.
	There are preparations being made for the forth-coming wedding of a maternal side family relative.
	I understood that there is no more financial money; therefore, to keep up the illusion of liquidity, the authorities want me to pretend that I am going to a job.
	I stepped into a north alley where a wood divides from the south, and it was a water-soaked delusion.
	Another family member that was following me and coming after me and I spoke about the overspreading water.
