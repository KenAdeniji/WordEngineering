While we build…

Hello Everyone,

While we’re building our app (for job seekers by job seekers), we’ve created a video for you to help with your interviews… just in case.
Video Thumbnail: Never say these 10 things (in an interview)

These tips are based on many years of experience on both sides of the interview fence.

FREE LIVE WEBINAR: Wednesday, Feb. 19th @ 3 PM Pacific

Since our Beta may be pushed out a little bit longer for reasons beyond our control, I want to offer a free webinar to help you with your specific needs in finding a job asap.

We’ll be going over the following:

    resume summaries

    cover letter customizations

    interview tips

    >> REGISTER HERE, AND BRING YOUR QUESTIONS! Our Zoom plan only allows the first 500 people to sign up, so get in while you can!

Want to be on a podcast/vlog?

Reply to this email if you want to share your experience with the job-search process: good, bad, or something in between.

We’re looking for energetic people!

During the recording, we will get to know you, your pain points, frustrations, BUT ALSO your goals, dreams, and skills! It’s a unique way to introduce yourself to the world, and who knows what opportunities might result?
 


We’re here for you!

Have a question or concern? Let us know by responding to this email.

Warmly,

Jessie
