Origin:Hebrew
Meaning:A fertile plain
Flourishing to the very fullest, Sharyn is a feminine name steeped in Hebrew history, meaning “a fertile plain.” Taken from the Christian Old Testament location of Sharon, blessed beyond compare with fruit-bearing soils, this soft-sounding appellation sings a song of adoration to the life-giving light in baby’s bright eyes. Sharyn also alludes to the rose of a Sharon, a pink-petalled plant of the early summer sun and a biblical symbol of breathtaking beauty. Parents will love this moniker for its floral feel, delighting daily as little Sharyn blossoms with splendid charm.
