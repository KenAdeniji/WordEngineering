The moment I shine ... the later You value.
I will like to be part of Your way ... not separated from Your ties.
Each according to You ... that is how I have made.
How can Word ... evolve as man?
I am not saying, leave where I am ... I am saying, use where I am.

What amounts to a person ... is choosing where You will not decline.
With spirit not ending where I favor.
To adjust my time ... according to Yours.
To make God a statement of my use.
Where I have a Father ... there are no change.

With love above ... who will change, ahead?
Our spirit lies ahead, if we are not apart?
When among the rest ... where am I satisfied?
