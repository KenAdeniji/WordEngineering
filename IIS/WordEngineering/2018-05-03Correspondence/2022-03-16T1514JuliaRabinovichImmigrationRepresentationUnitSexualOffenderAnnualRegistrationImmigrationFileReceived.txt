Good afternoon Mr. Adeniji,

 

I wanted to let you know I finally received your immigration file!  It is over 500 pages, but I will review it this week and be in touch next week with any questions.  For now, I just wanted to let you know we do have the file now.

Thank you for notifying me that you have received my immigration file.
