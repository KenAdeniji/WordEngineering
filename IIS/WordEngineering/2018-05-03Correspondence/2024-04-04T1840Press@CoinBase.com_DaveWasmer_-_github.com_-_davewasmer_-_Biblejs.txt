I saw your documentation at http://github.com/davewasmer/biblejs

Are you aware of related work? Specializing in software engineering for the Bible?

At this time, I am particularly interested in a scripture reference 
objected-oriented class for parsing multiple scripture references and
taking into consideration previous fragment.

Previous scripture reference: John 3
Append scripture reference: 17
New scripture reference: John 3, 17
