How can we let our people be ... as someone?
	
That is the transition ... the Catholic church ... had to make, 
	after personal scripture reading,
	and church groups not necessarily being led by a clergy member.

At Daigaku Honyaku Center (DHC):
	I migrated a Microsoft FoxPro application to an Intranet.
	The search query asp.net query was web-based .aspx
		As I have thought about it, today, I will use a .html page
			with client-side JavaScript events, add event listener.

	The decision we have to sum as us?
		Do I keep on restricting myself to Microsoft technology?
			Or do I adopt previously Google's and now Alphabet's Angular?
				versus (VS) 
			FaceBook's and now Meta's React?

		Which do I choose for my reliance?
			At Electronic Data Systems (EDS)/Westpac
				Using PowerBuilder, I replicated data between
					the Informix central database,
					and Watcom SQL Anywhere distributed database.
					
			At Case Corporation
				I repeated the same activity between Sybase
					and Watcom SQL Anywhere distributed database.

			At Reel.com, after advancement in technology ....
				the process was automated.

Between DHC, 2008, and today?
	No department are special.
		Amazon's cloud computing?
		WordPress publishing?

	What outlay are the same?
		Transfiguration on the Mount (Matthew 17:1–9, Mark 9:2–8, Luke 9:28–36)
			Moses, Elijah and Jesus Christ
			Where are my acceptance known?
			
		Where is the market shifting?
			During my consulting at Sybase/Powersoft
				Client/Server shifted to the Internet.

	What expertise is Microsoft's favor?
