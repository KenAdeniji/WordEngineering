Aman Sharma,

According to Chuck Missler of Koinonia House (KHouse.org), racism is bad, antisemitism worse of all.

I have an interview between 2024-11-14T09:00:00...2024-11-14T09:30:00.

2024-11-14T09:30:00...2024-11-14T10:00:00 Let us talk? My telephone number is (510) 796-8121. Your telephone number is +1 (510) 556 0905. I tried to call you at 2024-11-14T03:54:00, and I could not leave a voice mail.

If you have something planned...otherwise for yourself.
You can either pass history, or exclude it.

2024-11-14T04:24:00 Excluding the future...is not remaining any one.
