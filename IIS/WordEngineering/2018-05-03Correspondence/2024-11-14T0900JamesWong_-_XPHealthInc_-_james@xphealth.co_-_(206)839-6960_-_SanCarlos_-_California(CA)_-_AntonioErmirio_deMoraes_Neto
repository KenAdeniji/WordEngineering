2024-11-14T09:00:00...2024-11-14T09:30:00 Telephone interview appointment

I waited for James Wong telephone call for several minutes, after the appointed time of 2024-11-14T09:00:00.

I finally telephoned James Wong on (206) 839-6960.

James Wong asked me to tell him about myself?

I told James Wong that my resume and doctoral dissertation are available on the Internet and I have sent both to him via e-mail.

I asked James Wong to tell me about his company, XP Health?

James Wong said we are a Series-B start-up. We employ between 13...15 engineers.

I told James Wong that since the age of 27 years old I have been a contract consultant, and I am now 57 years old.

James Wong asked would you say your programming language is .NET?
