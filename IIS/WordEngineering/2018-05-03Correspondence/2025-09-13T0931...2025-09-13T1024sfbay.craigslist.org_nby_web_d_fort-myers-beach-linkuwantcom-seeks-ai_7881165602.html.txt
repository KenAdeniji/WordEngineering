linkUwant.com Seeks AI Developer for Geo-Domain Platform

Since 1999, linkUwant.com has curated a portfolio of over 35,000 geo-domain names pairing cities/states with 100+ services. We wish to restore our original business vision and are now seeking an AI developer to architect a next-generation advertising platform that dynamically generates unique commerce websites for each domain.

Each site must autonomously produce:

- Region-specific content and imagery
- Mobile-optimized, cross-browser compatible interfaces
- SEO-optimized architecture engineered for exceptional speed and load times

A few of the targeted service categories include:

Real Estate • Legal Services • Dental • Home Buying • Automotive • Rentals • Contractors • Plumbing • Medical • Lending • Retail Sales

Itemized list of domain names can be found at: https://linkUwant.com/domains

Fundamentally, we want to build an engine that transforms domains into commerce ecosystems.

linkUwant’s expansive scope of services targeted by this innovative platform encompasses a wide range of critical local business categories essential to community infrastructure and consumer needs. This includes, but is not limited to, the following sectors: Real Estate Agents and Agencies; Legal Services and Law Firms; Dental Professionals and Practices; Home Buying Assistance and Agencies; Automobile Sales, Services, and Dealerships; Rental Properties and For Rent Listings; General Contractors and Construction Services; Plumbing Installation and Repair Specialists; Medical Professionals and Healthcare Facilities; Lending Institutions and Financial Services; and general Goods and Services offered For Sale within specific localities. linkUwant’s envisioned platform represents a sophisticated technological solution designed to unlock the inherent value within this vast network of geo-domains, transforming them into active, high-performing commerce hubs that effectively bridge local service providers with their target customer base. In effect creating a “link-U-want” website.

The core objective of this significant project is the conception, design, and implementation of a groundbreaking, state-of-the-art advertising and monetization platform, engineered entirely from the foundational level upwards. This sophisticated system must possess the remarkable capability to dynamically generate, in real-time, fully functional and commercially viable websites tailored specifically to each individual geo-domain within the extensive portfolio. Crucially, linkUwant’s platform's automation must extend beyond mere templating; it must intelligently synthesize and deploy genuinely unique, high-quality textual content and regionally appropriate imagery for every single site generated. This content must be contextually relevant, meticulously crafted to reflect the precise geographic area (e.g., "SeattlePlumbing.com") and the specific service category (e.g., "AustinDentists.com") embedded within the domain name itself.

Furthermore, each dynamically created website must adhere to the highest contemporary standards of web development and user experience. This necessitates a design philosophy centered on universal accessibility and flawless performance. Consequently, every site must be meticulously optimized to deliver an exceptional, seamless, and fully responsive experience across the entire spectrum of internet-enabled devices—from the smallest smartphones and tablets to the largest desktop monitors—and must maintain consistent functionality and visual integrity across all major and current web browsers. Performance optimization is paramount; the platform must generate websites engineered for exceptional speed, ensuring rapid page load times to maximize user engagement and satisfaction. Simultaneously, search engine optimization (SEO) must be deeply integrated into the platform's core architecture. This requires the automatic implementation of robust SEO best practices—including semantic content structuring, meta-data optimization, schema markup generation, mobile-first indexing compliance, and fast-loading technical infrastructure—to ensure each geo-service site achieves maximum visibility and ranks competitively within major search engine results pages, thereby driving targeted organic traffic essential for monetization success.

Please submit your qualifications and vision for consideration.

    Principals only. Recruiters, please don't contact this job poster.
