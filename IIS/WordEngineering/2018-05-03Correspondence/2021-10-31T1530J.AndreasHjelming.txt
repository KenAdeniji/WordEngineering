I thank you, for your speedy response to my resume.

My background suits your company, in the following ways:

In 1988, as a 20 years old, I was deported to my country of birth, Nigeria, 
	after completing my Bachelors degree, and overstaying my visiting visa.
	This gave me the opportunity, to develop a wordprocessor, Kowe, using the Microsoft C language compiler.
	Kowe allows you to type alphabets in both English and my native language, Yoruba.
	It also contains a translator and dictionary.

In 1991, I migrated to Australia. 
	In Australia, my first place of employment was, 
		Military Head Quarters, Training Command, Suakin Drive.
	Prior to returning to the United States of America (USA),
		I visited Villawood Detention Center, every Friday, as a Christian missionary.
	Upon my return to the U.S., I worshipped at Jubilee Christian Center,
		and I visited prisons as part of the Frontline Ministry.
	
On both sides of the coin, the times are better.
It is my connection to the past, that represents my present.
