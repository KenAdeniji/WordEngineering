You need to update your tax residency details

Dear Kehinde,

We noticed the tax residency information we have for you is incorrect or incomplete and needs updating. (This could be the address, the country of tax residency, the Tax Identification Number (TIN) or something else).

It's important you update this information as soon as you can.
divider
Why do you need to do this?

We're asking you for this information because Australia has tax agreements with a number of countries to help prevent tax evasion. This means Australian banks need to collect tax residency information from their customers.
What do you need to do?

You can update the account details online through NetBank or the CommBank app. Alternatively, you can complete a new Individual tax residency self-certification form and either email it to us or take it to a CommBank branch. (A copy of the form is available on our website by searching Collecting customer tax information).
To update using NetBank

    You'll need the NetBank client number and password to log on.
    Select Settings in the top right (On mobile: in the top left menu select Settings then Profile).
    Under My Details select Citizenship, Residency & Tax Residency and then follow the prompts. 

To update using the CommBank app

    Open the CommBank app on your phone.
    Select the message bubble top right.
    Choose Message us, type in 'Update tax residency' and then follow the prompts. 

To update by email

    Complete and sign an Individual tax residency self-certification form.
    Scan or take a picture of the completed form.
    Email the image to your Relationship Manager or to cfpt@cba.com.au or take the form to your nearest CommBank branch.

    Note: Email isn't always secure, so it's a good idea to password protect the attachments and send the password instructions in a separate message. 

Contact us

To find out more you can search Collecting customer tax information on our website or talk with your Relationship Manager. You can also contact us by searching Contact us on our website or message us in the CommBank app.

Yours sincerely,
The CommBank Team

Your security, our priority.

We'll never send you an email or SMS asking for banking information like your NetBank Client ID, password, or NetCode; or include a link to log on directly from an email or SMS. Always search CommBank in a browser or use the CommBank app to securely access your banking. If something looks suspicious from CommBank, forward it to hoax@cba.com.au and delete it.
