2024-07-23T19:48:00 Promise Hill was parked in front of the Wienerschnitzel drive-thru window.
I asked Promise Hill if it was okay to ride home with her, and she confirmed yes.
So I got inside Promise Hill's car.
One of your lookalike male employees spoke rudely to me.
I do not know his name, but I can identify him.
This is not the 1st occasion that I will interact with him; therefore, 2024-07-24T02:50:00 it was uncalled for.

2024-07-24T12:35:00 Juan Ortega is the name of the male employee, and the telephone number of the restaurant is (510) 792-9618.
2024-07-24T18:49:00	Pedro Ortega collaborated that Promise Hill said I am her neighbor.

	I heard falsehood from class associates.
	There are preparations being made for the forth-coming wedding of a maternal side family relative.
	I understood that there is no more financial money; therefore, to keep up the illusion of liquidity, the authorities want me to pretend that I am going to a job.
	I stepped into a north alley where a wood divides from the south, and it was a water-soaked delusion.
	Another family member that was following me and coming after me and I spoke about the overspreading water.

Dear Ken Adeniji,

Thank you for your loyalty to our brand. I apologize that Jonathan Ortega didnâ€™t provide the best service that we offer.

Since all locations are independently owned and operated and each Franchisee hires their own staff, I shared your information with the Franchisee so he can call you and discuss your concerns.

 

Best regards,

Marles Gonzales

Awon te se dada.
Us that didn't do well.
Awon te se deda. Us that didn't do well. 1st scene, 37 Adebola Street: Uncle Adesegun Oluwole Abdul Rasheed Adeniji was standing outside the house to the north-east.
I understood a person, who was probably a female, being pulled unwillingly into the sky.
2nd scene, Reel.com, south-center east, the latter cubicle: I am working at a video cassette seller. The athletes were participating in a sports event.
An older African man that reminds me of Miles of Wilson Market Research (Wilson MLI) said maybe there will be an aged category for seniors.

It is love... pretense... the Devil.
Location: Paseo Padre Parkway, east, between Hall Way and Blackstone Way.
Yesterday evening, 2024-08-18, I saw and greeted Moslem women at Albertsons Lucky, Charter Square, Mary's Bakery, and 99 Ranch Market.
At 99 Ranch Market, as I spoke to 2 Moslem women, the Caucasian male security guard asked me, "Are you going to buy anything or not. If you are not, I have to ask you to leave?"
