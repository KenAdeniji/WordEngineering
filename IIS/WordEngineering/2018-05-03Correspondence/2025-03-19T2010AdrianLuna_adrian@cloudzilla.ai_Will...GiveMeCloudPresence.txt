Will Cloudzilla.ai freely supplement my cloud hosting for my Doctorate dissertation?

Hey there,

Weâ€™re building something we wish existed before â€” a way to launch apps into every cloud without fighting YAML files or endless configs. Extra credit for always running on the lowest cost provider in locations near end users.

Itâ€™s called Cloudzilla, and weâ€™re inviting a few devs to take it for a spin. You can launch up to 3 projects for free â€” no catch, no credit card, just create an account and deploy.

If youâ€™re down to try it out, weâ€™d love to have you.

ðŸ‘‰ Jump In

No pressure. Just curious to see what you build and maybe even get some feedback. 

Cheers,

Adrian Luna
