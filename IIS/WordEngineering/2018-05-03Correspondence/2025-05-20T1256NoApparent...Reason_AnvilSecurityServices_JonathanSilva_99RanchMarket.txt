    As I walked into 99 Ranch Market, south-west door, 15:52 Jonathan Silva, the Hispanic security guard of Anvil Security Services, Inc. ordered me:
        Can you close it?
	At 99 Ranch Market, I walked northward to the north-east border, and the word came as I was walking southward to the south-east border. 
	At Wienerschnitzel, I heard the music lyrics, never let them sleep.
