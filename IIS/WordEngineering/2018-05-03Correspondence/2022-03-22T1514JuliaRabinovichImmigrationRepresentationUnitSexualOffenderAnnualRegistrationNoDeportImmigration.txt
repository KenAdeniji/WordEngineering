Like we discussed, after reviewing your full immigration file, our office has determined you are not deportable, which is great news!  Because you do not need to have any of your convictions vacated for immigration purposes, I’m going to close out your immigration case with our office. 

 

I know you are still interested in getting your registration issue resolved.  You can contact Erika Watts in our office about that: 510-272-6651.

 

We are not able to assist with the naturalization process, but I strongly encourage you to work with an attorney if you would like to reapply for citizenship.  Here are two organizations who assist with citizenship applications:

 

Centro Legal de la Raza: 510-437-1554

Pangea Legal Services: 415-254-0475

 

Sometimes these organizations do not have a person available to immediately take your call, but you should leave a message and explain that you are looking for help with your citizenship application.  It may take them a few weeks to call you back but someone should return your call.  Feel free to let me know if you are not hearing back from anyone, I may be able to contact someone there directly.

 

I also have a full copy of your immigration file, and I’m happy to share that with you or your future attorney if you decide to apply for citizenship.  Just let them know to reach out to me.

Mr. Adeniji,

 

I know an attorney at Centro Legal who may be able to help starting in May.  If you haven’t had any luck finding anyone by then to help with your citizenship application, please reach out to me directly, and I can try to put you in touch.
