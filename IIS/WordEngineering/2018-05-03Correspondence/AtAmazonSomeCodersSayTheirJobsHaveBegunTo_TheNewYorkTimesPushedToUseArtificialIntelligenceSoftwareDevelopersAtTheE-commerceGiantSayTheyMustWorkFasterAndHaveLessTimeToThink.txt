I returned to my workplace in the west.
I walked to the center-east, and I probably saw some Ibo, eastern Nigerians. They had food, and the path to the west was blocked.
The blockage was removed, and I walked westward. In the north-center, which was my former work location, there was only a monitor and not a computer. In the center, on the floor, I saw other monitor(s).
