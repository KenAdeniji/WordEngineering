Email Confirmation Required
Hey there,
Quick favor — we need you to confirm your email address.
We started FreshCareerFinder because we were tired of seeing friends waste time on job boards full of ghost postings and "entry-level" jobs requiring a decade of experience.
We do things differently here. Every job is verified. No spam. No nonsense. Just real opportunities that match what you're actually looking for.
But first, we need to make sure you're a real person (not a bot), so...
Confirm My Email →
Takes literally 2 seconds
Once you're in, here's what happens:
→ You tell us what you're looking for
→ We send you matching jobs (real ones)
→ You apply to what interests you
→ No spam, ever (I hate that stuff too)
That's it. No tricks, no gimmicks.
Looking forward to helping you find something great,
The FreshCareerFinder Team
P.S. — If you didn't sign up for this, just ignore this email. No hard feelings. But if you did, don't forget to confirm or you won't get any job matches!

your paid focus group assignment..start now.
Justin Jones info@apexfocusgroup.com
​
You​

Hi,

Thank you for registering with Apex Focus Group for the opportunity of becoming a focus group panelist.

My name is Justin Jones and I would like to welcome you to the group!

There's just a few things we need to cover, and then you can begin the questionnaire to your first Focus Group assignment.

1) Be sure and whitelist us/add us to your contacts. A few times each week we will be sending "private invite only" assignments worth up to $750 each! And I am sure you won't want to miss out on that.

Don't worry...you can apply for as many or as few of the focus group assignments as you please.

2) Please note that "each" Focus Group or Clinical Trial opportunity will require you to complete a questionnaire to see if you qualify.

Some of our members qualify for several opportunities, while others may only qualify for a few or none at all.

Each opportunity is different, but keep applying to assignments as this will give you the best chance of being approved and earning the most income.

3) Click here for your private link to complete your first Focus Group questionnaire!

4) Go here to register and participate in your first paid Market Research Assignment.


Best of luck,

Justin Jones
Apex Focus Group
