Hello,

I apologize for the issue, but I was unable to find any ACCESS CI registration attempt for . I looks like your registration attempt was not saved. I recommend you start the process again.

Please visit https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user-direct and enter your name and email address to get started.

Again, sorry for the issue. Let me know (by replying to this email) if you continue to have issues registering for an ACCESS account.

This is a web page, not an organization such as a university or corporation.
Instead, when you register for ACCESS, for your organization just choose "individual/unaffiliated."

Camille Goudeseune changed the status to Resolved.

Camille Goudeseune resolved this as Won't Do.
