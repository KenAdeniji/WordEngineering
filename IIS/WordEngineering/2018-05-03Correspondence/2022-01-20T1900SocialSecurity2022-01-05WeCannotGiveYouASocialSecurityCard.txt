You have not given us the document(s) we need to show U.S. citizenship or lawful alien
status.

Please contact us when you can give us the documents we need.

This notice is not proof of ineligibility for a Social Security number or card.

If you disagree with the decision

If you think you should get a Social Security number or card based on what you have given
us, you can ask us to review your case. Someone who did not look at your first application will
