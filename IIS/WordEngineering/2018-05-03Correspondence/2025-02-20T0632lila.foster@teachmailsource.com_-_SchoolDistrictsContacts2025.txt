For 3 years, I tutored at Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC), Charlotte, North Carolina (NC), which was at that time 1 of the top 5 community colleges in the United States of America (USA).
I have 40-year experience in the computer information technology industry.
I presently cannot afford to compensate you for your information, but I will appreciate your data, and I will add you to my reference.
