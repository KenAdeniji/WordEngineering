I know an attorney at Centro Legal who may be able to help starting in May.  If you havenâ€™t had any luck finding anyone by then to help with your citizenship application, please reach out to me directly, and I can try to put you in touch.

I have not made progress with the two organizations you provided:

Centro Legal de la Raza: 510-437-1554
Pangea Legal Services: 415-254-0475

Please kindly identify the name of your contact, and connect us together.
