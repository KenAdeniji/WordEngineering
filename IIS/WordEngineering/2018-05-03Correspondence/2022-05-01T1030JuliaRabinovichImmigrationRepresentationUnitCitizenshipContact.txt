I know an attorney at Centro Legal who may be able to help starting in May.  If you havenâ€™t had any luck finding anyone by then to help with your citizenship application, please reach out to me directly, and I can try to put you in touch.

I have not made progress with the two organizations you provided:

Centro Legal de la Raza: 510-437-1554
Pangea Legal Services: 415-254-0475

Please kindly identify the name of your contact, and connect us together.

Hi Mr. Adeniji,

 

I spoke with the attorney I know at Centro Legal, and unfortunately they are not able to take on any more naturalization cases this year. 

 

But, I recently learned of another organization that may be able to help.  They are called International Institute of the Bay Area.  They charge $30 for the initial consult, but if you are low income, they should not charge for the rest of the naturalization process (aside from any fees immigration charges).  

 

There is an attorney there named Sara MacPherson who I spoke to briefly to let her know you may reach out.  You can call her at: (510) 451-2846 ext. 340.  I hope she might be able to help you.

 

Good luck!

 

Julia

Hi Mr. Adeniji,

 

I received your voicemail, and I have reached out to an attorney to see if she might be able to help.  I hope to hear back this week.
