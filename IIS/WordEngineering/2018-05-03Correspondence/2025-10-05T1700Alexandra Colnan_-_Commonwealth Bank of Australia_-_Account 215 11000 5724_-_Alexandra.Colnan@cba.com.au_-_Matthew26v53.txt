Dear Kehinde Adewumi Adeniji,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Jonathan Victor, Senior Paralegal Officer in the Federal Trademark & Copyrights Department at Legal Filing Firm.

We have recently received an application from the State of Florida to federally register the business name “Www.jesusinthelamb.com” for trademark protection across all 50 states. During our review of the USPTO database, we noted that you were the original applicant for this trademark under serial number 90050770. However, the application was marked as abandoned on Apr. 28, 2021.

In accordance with our legal policy, we are reaching out to offer you the first opportunity to reclaim and refile the trademark under your ownership before moving forward with the new applicant. If we do not receive a response from you promptly, we will be obligated to proceed with the current applicant’s filing, which would grant them exclusive legal rights to the name.

Please be aware that once the trademark is registered to another party, they will have sole ownership and enforcement rights. This would require you to cease all use of the name “Www.jesusinthelamb.com” in branding, advertising, and business operations. The USPTO follows a strict first-to-file policy, and trademark rights are enforceable under The Lanham Act of 1946.

To avoid losing this opportunity, we urge you to respond without delay. If you wish to reclaim the trademark, please reply to this email, call us at (855) 669-9909, or send a text to confirm your decision. We will then connect you with an attorney to begin the refiling process immediately.
Failure to act promptly may result in legal consequences and the permanent loss of rights to the business name.

We look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Jonathan Victor
Senior Paralegal Officer
Legal Filing Firm
