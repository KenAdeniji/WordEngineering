2025-07-03T13:42:00 Where the blessing... go?

2025-07-02 When Adeyemo Adewuyi Adeniji versus (VS) my adopted father? Who is he talking about?

2025-07-03T14:18:00 With Adeyemo Adewuyi Adeniji, my adopted father, he was a team leader. He complained that I did not have a team scope.

2025-07-03T14:22:00 You must know the person... to know the relationship?

2025-07-03T14:23:00 Time was important to Him... so He made it partial.
2025-07-03T14:24:00 I have to record the word... and the time.

2025-07-03T14:38:00 Post-dated: I asked my Adeyemo Adewuyi Adeniji, my adopted father... 2025-07-03T14:43:00 I didn't see the skill... in his game.
