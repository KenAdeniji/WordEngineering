2024-12-21 22:31:52.183 This talk... are normal... of my reflection.
    Albertsons Lucky, Charter Square. I bought donuts. They were brown, orange, and white.
    I asked 2 Hindi males, if they were Moslems?
    1 of the 2 Hindi males walked westward towards me. He harrassed me, and he ended his assault charges by asking, "Do you want to start trouble?"
    I am walking eastward towards the south-center. The separation between Albertsons Lucky and the other buildings is to its east. 22:54 Center road.
    Dulhan Grocery. Pure water signpost light.
