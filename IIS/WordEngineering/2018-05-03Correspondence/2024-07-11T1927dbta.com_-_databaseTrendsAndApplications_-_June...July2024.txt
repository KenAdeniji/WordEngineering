The stumbling block for me at PowerSoft was that I did not see the need to transition from spreadsheet to client/server relational database.

I did not keep track of my personal information; therefore, how could I maintain enterprise data?

A spreadsheet is likely a list, but a relational database may have islands of information that require reverse-engineering and metadata?

The sample html file, JSON query, JSONPath, that I built yesterday, contains transient JSON fragment. 

A more appropriate concept is to provide a url import to the data.

	More than a decade ago, the game LovePlus became popular in Japan, offering a virtual girlfriend on a Nintendo device. Thousands of Japanese young men “fell in love” with these virtual girlfriends. Some even went through marriage ceremonies with their cyber-girlfriends.
	Human Companionship
		Will an increasing number of people, disproportionately men, withdraw from the challenges of real human relationships in favor of AI? Indeed, there is some evidence of this trend already. The percentage of U.S. men reporting no sex within a 12-month period jumped from 10% in 2008 to 28% in 2018. Women showed some increase, but not to anywhere near the same extent. Obviously, AI cannot be responsible for that jump, but online lifestyles probably have something to do with it. When online life includes virtual girlfriends, the trend will probably increase.
