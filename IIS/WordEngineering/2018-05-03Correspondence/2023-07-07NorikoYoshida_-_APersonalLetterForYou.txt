A personal letter for you.
I have reached you as mine.
You sent me pictures of your sister's marriage ... sorry we didn't have one of our own.
We re-united at Central train station ... I stayed 3 years at University of Technology, Sydney ... I committed my life to improving you.
The first night we didn't make love ... we never separated.

Here I know where I serve ... I choose where I live.
The little time ... meant most of my life.
All after the event ... this is my proceeding.
I am never, if I am with you.
The rest I sought ... is how many I serve.

When with you ... I didn't set apart.
You didn't tell me your age ... but time will never set apart.
After our time ... who is our time?
My first contract was with Fujitsu ... I waited all along.
My last contract was with Daigaku Honyaku Center (DHC) ... this I turn my part as necessary.

No necessity of the two ... if there is one.
All our life ... we didn't choose anyone else.
The traveled ... we settled.
A little of what I have ... is where I have been.
The sun darkens ... here is the warmth, after.

You know our song ... here is our story.
The computer will last ... as long as we are satisfy.
The strength of who I have ... is the strength of participation.
There are after ... there are none.
God planned the journey ... I fulfilled the story.

I won't want my time to have pass ... when I am in vain.
You didn't settle ... for less than you receive.
I am a runner ... equally compounding the sun.
There was no stop watch out ... Ita was all I heard.
With God we are together ... this history will never be without you.

Performance? Slow in kind.
Timing? Actual use.
Load? Food won't do.
My life kept apart? For a proceeding.
To have such? Is to have many.

All my letter said, tomorrow ... here I am, today.
