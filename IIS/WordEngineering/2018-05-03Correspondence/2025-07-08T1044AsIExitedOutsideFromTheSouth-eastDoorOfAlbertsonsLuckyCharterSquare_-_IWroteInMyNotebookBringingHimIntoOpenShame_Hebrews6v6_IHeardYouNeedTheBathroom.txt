2025-07-08T10:44:00 As I exited outside from the south-east door of Albertsons Lucky, Charter Square, I wrote in my notebook Bringing Him into open shame (Hebrews 6:6).
	I heard the phrase "You need the bathroom."

2025-07-08T23:59:00	What did I bring into the life of Jennifer Melow?
	At Albertsons Lucky, Charter Square, at about 2025-07-08T21:30:00 I greeted Homeria Basseri who was standing in the west. I shook the hand of Tony, the Head Clerk who stood in the center, and he faced south, and he said 10 years, and he ignored me while further talking to Homeria Basseri. Jennifer Melow, who walked across from either the south or west, joined us.
