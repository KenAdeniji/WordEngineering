I have a table of words, which we can use and apply your infrastructure to parse?

I am a doctorate candidate and my area of research is using 
the Word of God to predict our world.

A resemblance to the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_code

My focus, at the moment, is to bring technology to the ministry.

I have never been involved in building open-source technology.
I am not familiar with Discord.

My specialty with artificial intelligence (AI) is mainly
Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), and some knowledge of
Neural Networks; this exposure started during my
Masters degree program between 1993 and 1995.

I have strong expertise in SQL, C#, HTML, Javascript.

Anticipating the past, is progressing the future.

The word of today, are no more; if we are absent, tomorrow.

How I am use; is how I seem as Me
(Matthew 3:10, Matthew 7:17-Matthew 7:19 , Matthew 12:33, Matthew 13:8, Matthew 13:23, Mark 4:8, Mark 4:20, Luke 3:9, Luke 6:43, Luke 8:8, Luke 8:15, Luke 12:18)?

To skill; to tool?
