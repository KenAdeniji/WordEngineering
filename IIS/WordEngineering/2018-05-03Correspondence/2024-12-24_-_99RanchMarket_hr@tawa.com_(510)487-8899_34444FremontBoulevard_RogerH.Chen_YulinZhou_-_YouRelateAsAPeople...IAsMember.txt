	Numbers 23:9
	At the intersection of Paseo Padre Parkway and Blackstone Way, south-east. Walking southward.

2024-12-23T14:41:00 At 99 Ranch Market, hot stove, an Asian male customer and his family gave me 3 $2 vouchers making $6.
I volunteered to give it away, but no customer received it. I used it to pay, and I added $1 on my VISA card. 
A Hispanic male security guard of Anvil Security Services that was standing to the south-west of the hot stove in the front of the bakery asked for my receipt? 
I said I did not get a receipt, but he could walk me to the hot stove clerk for verification.
