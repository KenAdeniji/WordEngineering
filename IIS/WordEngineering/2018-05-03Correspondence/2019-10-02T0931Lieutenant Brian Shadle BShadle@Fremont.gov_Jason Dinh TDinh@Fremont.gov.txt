Jason Dinh and I, spoke this morning.
Jason Dinh was very rude, Jason asked for my height and weight? I told Jason,
that my height is 5' 4", I don't know my weight.
Jason dropped the phone on me.

I found out my weight, it is 180 lbs.

Jason called back, and we scheduled an appointment to register as a sexual offender at 2019-10-14T18:00:00, Monday 6PM.

I tried to clarify, how Jason spells his first name and e-mail address, but he didn't affirm.
