Zoom interview between 2022-12-13T16:00:00 ... 2022-12-13T16:49:00 
For the role of Database and Application Administrator with the following personnel:

Rose Marie Griffin
Nagish Jain
Tony Bettini

When I interviewed for the role of Sybase/Powersoft Australia, first consultant, the
only question that I did not handily answer was the one about multi-tier architecture?

The separation:
	Database server
	User inteface (UI) client
	Application server

My relationship with Microsoft will expose me to:

	Power BI
	Reporting Services
	Entity Framework
	MSTest
	OStress
	FXCop
	Azure Data Studio

While the Microsoft SQL Server Maintenance Plan is useful for scheduling backup 
and other housekeeping; I still favor ad-hoc activities and tasks.

Since my first consulting role at Metal Manufactures (MM), Port Kembla,
I have programmed stored procedures using PL/SQL.
For the sake of database variety, while acknowledging network load,
I have customized application logic between the server and client.

In my last consulting role at Daigaku Honyaku Center (DHC),
I built an Intranet which was not Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) centric.

At Loan Performance, I moved data from the 5GL FoxPro to SQL Server,
using Microsoft SQL Server Data Transformation Services (DTS), the
precursor to Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).
Since the year 2002, I have written scripts to load data from 
Microsoft Access to Microsoft SQL Server.

Since the year 1997, I have focused on Microsoft SQL Server,
and I have monitored error log, query plans, performance monitor.

The Microsoft SQL Server transaction begin, rollback and commit 
Transact SQL statement are useful for migration and complex
work.
