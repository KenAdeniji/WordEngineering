I telephoned (408) 984-3495, Barnes & Noble Booksellers #1944, 3600 Stevens Creek Boulevard, San Jose, California (CA) 95117.
I requested to speak to Jeremiah Word, the Territorial Manager, but Shante said she was the manager.
Since the textbook was misleading in its title: Java for Programming with Generative AI, I pleaded with Shante for a monetary refund. 
Shante rudely said Barnes & Noble only gives gift cards refund for e-mail receipts. Have a good night.

    First appeared 1995-05-23; 30 years ago

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotJava
    Initial release 1997-03-24; 28 years ago

I have been programming in the Java programming language since its introduction when Ury Schecow, my Master’s degree supervisor at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), introduced me to the Java programming language and HotJava, the applet browser.

In the last 30 years, I have bought a copy of Symantec's Visual Café for Java, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Caf%C3%A9, and several Java programming language text books.

The only reason I bought the additional and extra Java for Programming with Generative AI textbook is that it claimed to specialize in Generative AI; therefore, I sought to supplement my learning and intelligence with its proclamation.
But it only covers chapter 19, OpenAI, out of 22 chapters.

Returning Items Bought in Barnes & Noble Stores

If you're not satisfied with your purchase, a full refund for the original purchase price, including any applicable taxes, will be issued in store for returns of new and unread/unopened merchandise made within 30 days of purchase with a store sales receipt with the below qualifications:

    Eligible refunds will generally be made to your original form of tender. For purchases made with a credit card, debit card or mobile payment, the original form of payment must be present at the time of return to receive a refund. Store credit in the form of an electronic gift card will be issued if the original form of payment is not available.
    For returns with a gift receipt, a store credit will be issued in the form of an electronic gift card for the purchase price within 60 days of purchase. A store credit will also be issued for all textbook returns.
    Items purchased as part of a Buy X, Get Y Free offer are available for exchange only, unless all items purchased as part of the offer are returned, in which case such items are available for a refund (within 30 days). Exchanges of the items sold at no cost are available only for items of equal or lesser value than the original cost of such item.
    Returns or exchanges will not be permitted after 30 days or without receipt or for product not carried by Barnes & Noble.
    Items purchased from a Barnes & Noble store must be returned to a Barnes & Noble store, but you are not required to return it at the same Barnes & Noble store where the purchase was originally made (Ex: an item purchased in a New York City store can be returned to a store in New Jersey as long as it is within the return timeframe).

Who is your manager? Crazy mister Martin. Mister Martin as a good (Ezra 2:40, Colossians 2:6)

Scene 1:
My twin sibling and I were supposed to drive to the store.
My twin sibling climbed inside a big truck in the seat of the driver to the south.
As I attempted to climb inside the big truck into the passenger seat to the north.
My twin sibling said he was sleepy, and we could not go to the store anymore.

Scene 2:
We went inside a house in the west.
In the south-west, a man said Israel is the bride.

Scene 1: Both my twin sibling and I planned to go to a party hosted by a fellow African man.
Friday Stance Arunwunde who works, volunteered to drive us to the party, saying that he also heard about the party, and he knew the host.
I was wearing a business shirt and trousers, which may not be appropriate dress for the party.
My dress Friday Stance Arunwunde frowned on, and other party guests may also not find appropriate.
Friday Stance Arunwunde and my twin sibling drove to the party, while leaving me behind.

Scene 2: At a scenery like the intersection of Bascom Avenue and San Carlos Street, north-east, I placed glass bottles into a waste management bin.
At the intersection of Bascom Avenue and San Carlos Street, south-west, a female scolded me for my appearance and work.
This setting also resembles the Barnes & Noble location. 3600 Stevens Creek Boulevard.
At the intersection of Stevens Creek Boulevard and San Tomas Expressway, San Jose, California (CA) 95117.
