California Brings Solar Energy To Qualified Homeowners
If you pay more than $99/month for power, you will most likely qualify for this program.
David MillerNovember 27th, 2023

Savvy homeowners who are fed up with rising energy costs are starting to take advantage of new government savings programs. These programs are massive, especially the California Solar Programs that encourage homeowners to use clean energy by reducing solar power projects to $0 installations.

In order to get more people to switch to clean solar energy the federal and state governments are highly incentivizing homeowners who live in specific zip codes to go solar with $1000’s of dollars in rebates and incentives. Homeowners that qualify are able to drastically reduce their power bills without any upfront costs. If you're paying more than $99/month for power, the savings can be very substantial.

When homeowners visit Energybillcruncher to see if they qualify, many are shocked to learn that solar panels can be installed on their home with no upfront costs after rebates and solar incentives. You can find out which solar incentives are offered in your area by using your zip code. You can even use this tool to help calculate your savings by entering your utility provider and your average power bill. In many cases, customers are saving up to 70% on the cost of powering their home each year.

With rebates being as high as they are, homeowners are able to drastically reduce their power bill without paying a single penny out of their own pocket.
