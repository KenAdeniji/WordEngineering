When loving breaks.
It is so unusual, to feel undeserted.
Telling the story, sings on.
If the two of us, are after; where is the beginning.
No where tell the story, as occupying of the mind.

In love, there are two; in one, there are many.
All you gave, is where, I will meet some.
Share the dream, that life spreads.
Letting the beginning, never end.
Holding one's end, it tells all the future.

Created for a lifetime of sparing.
You know the love that dreams; is a love, that is never apart.
Mostly is expectant of the end, that never associate the beginning.
A openess desire, that ever share love, that meets.
To whose love, I desire; is to whose end, I will never be apart.

Could we live a dream, that never elapse?
Could we tell, we are so for sure?
Could we lead each other?
Where life dreams, dream are never forsaking.
You know what you want; I know, what will so be after me.

To life, secluded of the future.
A life, where the dream assist.
A want for one another, never ending.
There will never be another of you, one living shared rest.
A hope the divine, will share the same.

The moments, are for you and I.
The meeting, will never be missing.
To life, endear the rest.
Living for the two; where gaps never decline.
I miss you, that is life shared apart.

I will seek; you may seek, but it will never share the rest.
The life, that say forever; may not lost, forever.
You know whose life, far I move.
All I bring, is so much, for you to find.
Could one separate from he has been; to see where he will be?

Telling today, what will happen, tomorrow; is not seeing, where I have live.
I don't want to be a part, of where I will never be, again.
A life that draws me apart; is a life that seeks me in solitude.
That don't be part of yesterday, if tomorrow is never again.
The fulling of desire, is the feeling of appreciation.
