    In the shower, I held the sponge.
   
I asked the customers of Albertsons Lucky, Charter Square, who Alexis was attending to as a clerk. Where are you from?
The husband of the customers asked in response, "Where are you from"?
I answered I am Nigerian, but I used to live in Australia.
The husband partner of the customers responded, "We are not from around here".
    The 2 probably Jewish men at Wienerschnitzel answered the same.
The husband partner of the customers opened a soft drink, soda, and drank from it. The husband of the customers gave a drink to the wife of the customers.
Inside the bakery, the wife of Ray, Agnes, was standing beside the donuts, and I asked for some donuts. She said "they are not cooked yet".

Use-case title: The Budding of Aaron's Rod (Numbers 17).

I remembered the slogan of President Donald Trump, Make America Great Again (MAGA).
