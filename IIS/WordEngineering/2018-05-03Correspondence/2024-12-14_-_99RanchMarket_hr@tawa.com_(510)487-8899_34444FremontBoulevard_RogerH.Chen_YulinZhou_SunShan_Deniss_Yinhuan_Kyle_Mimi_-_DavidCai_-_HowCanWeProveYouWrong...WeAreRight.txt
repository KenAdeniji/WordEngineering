2024-12-14T19:47:00 Both Shan Sun the Asian male employee and Deniss the Hispanic male security guard rudely said Not Inside, as I walked into 99 Ranch Market, 34444 Fremont Boulevard, Fremont, California (CA) 94555.
    I asked Yinhuan to call the store manager, Yulin Zhou.
	David Cai of Bing's Dumpling said I do not work here.
	
2024-12-14T20:00:00    The store manager, Yulin Zhou and I spoke.
    The Hispanic security male finally said his name was Deniss.
    2024-12-14T20:11:00    Yulin Zhou told me that the Asian male employee that Lisa Zhai called Kwong's actual name is Sun Shan.
