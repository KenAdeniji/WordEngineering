Cecilia Cardenas, Martin, Ethan, Carl, Tiffany.

I thank you for sharing your home, this evening.

I may not be able to continue, in your steadfast love.

Martin's conversation with the Bible is insightful.

I grew with the ministry, that is where I belong.

Again, this brief time, we spent together, will always stay with me.

When you look for, where do I turn?

What brings us together, will never share us apart.

When one turns, that is the assurance, I have put.

We have physically joined.

Even though our end may not meet; there we have started.

Keep on growing as the true alike.

I pray, your three sons, the fun we have started.

Created for you, is a place, where I have shared.

You may ask, where is my living? The contentment of the LORD is true.

Sharing is all purposeful of the word.

Now, I have to go, but you follow me, where I belong.

I am happy and grateful, multi-cultural setting.

If God didn't share us together, where should we begin?
