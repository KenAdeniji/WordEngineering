2024-03-11T09:11:00 My sin...is ever before me.
	After a Wal-Mart truck passed Highway 880 North Paseo Padre Parkway overhead bridge.
	
I had just left Wienerschnitzel and was headed...to Charter Square...Albertsons Lucky.
A Busch light beer truck drove pass westward on Fremont Boulevard at the front of 99 Ranch Market.
At the intersection of Fremont Boulevard and Paseo Padre Parkway, traffic light North East.
	An African American male that is taller than me and with a probably Caucasian female punched me in the face.
	I fell down westward and my probably fractured left palm hit the floor.
I ran into Mary's Bakery and I asked to call the police emergency at telephone number 911.
	The female telephone operator asked if I speak another language, 
		and on several occasions, she asked for physical descriptions, she also asked if I will need an ambulance?
	The dispatched police officer(s) stopped at the front of Wienerschnitzel and questioned me?
