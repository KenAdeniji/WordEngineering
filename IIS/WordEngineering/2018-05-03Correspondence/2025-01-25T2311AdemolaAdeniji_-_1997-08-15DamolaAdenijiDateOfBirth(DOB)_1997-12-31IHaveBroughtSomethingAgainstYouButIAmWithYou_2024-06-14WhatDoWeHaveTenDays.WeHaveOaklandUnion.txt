1997-08-15    The date of birth (DOB) of Adedamola Adeniji.
1997-12-31    I have brought something against you... but I Am with you.
    I was expecting a visit from a Yugoslav-born female mentor, Nada Madjar, who was raised in New Zealand (NZ), but I did not open the door.
        During my first few months in Australia, Nada Madjar and I met at a Baptist church in Crows Nest, New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
        At that time, Nada Madjar was working as an editor at Reader's Digest.
        Nada Madjar was dating Isaac, a man from Ivory Coast who had migrated from France.
        Isaac was pursuing his Doctorate degree, and Isaac was working at Telstra, the then monopolistic Australian government-owned sole telecommunications provider.

    In the south-west, I left a young Adedamola Jonathan Adebowale Adeniji on a seat and I walked north-west.
	I sought the protection of 2 men, and they followed me towards the south-west to join Damola. 
	Damola had mingled with other children that were in the south east.
	My interpretation is that Damola should attend the redeemed church with uncle Demola, and he should have security clearance.

	I feel it's missing from our younger generation.
