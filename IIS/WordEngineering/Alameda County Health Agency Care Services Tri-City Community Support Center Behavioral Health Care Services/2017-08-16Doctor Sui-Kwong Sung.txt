I contacted CVS pharmacy for medication, on both 2017-08-11 and 2017-08-15.

On 2017-08-11, CVS said, they need to get authorization from my doctor.

On 2017-08-15, CVS said, my doctor, did not authorize medication.

I spoke to doctor Sui Sung on 2017-07-10, and we agreed, I won't be signing papers.

I went to see doctor Sui Sung, 2017-07-12T13:30:00, and the first question he asked me,

was to sign the papers, I decline.

On several occasions, doctor Sui Sung, has said, he won't authorize medication,

pending me signing papers.

At multiple times, doctor Sui Sung, will refuse to sign my application for 

Regional Transit Connection Discount Card, which expired on 2016-06-30.

Thank you, and God blesses.
