Hi Ken,

I have scheduled you a one-hour TeleHealth appointment for this coming Tuesday March 12th at 3pm. I will CALL YOUR PHONE AT THAT TIME.

We can then catch up and schedule an IN PERSON meeting after that call. But expect my call Tuesday at 3pm.

Also, the encrypted messages you are leaving are not able to be opened by the county server. Please just ask to be connected to me in person as these encrypted messages being sent are not opened by the county system.

My number is 510-795-2474.

You are on the schedule for March 12 at 3pm for TeleHealth call. Be sure to pick up at that time.
