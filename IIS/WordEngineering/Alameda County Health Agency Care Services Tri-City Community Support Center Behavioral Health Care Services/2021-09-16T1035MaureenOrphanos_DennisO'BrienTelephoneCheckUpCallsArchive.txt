On 2021-09-15, yesterday, I listened to a telephone voice mail recording that said,
Doctor Dennis O'Brien, will call me today at 10:00AM, 2021-09-16T10:00:00.

Doctor Dennis O'Brien called to say that he is just checking up on me.
Doctor Dennis O'Brien said, he will call back in November.

I explained to Doctor Dennis O'Brien, that HIPAA stipulates, one annual call.

Doctor Dennis O'Brien said medication, and he will call back in December.

Thank you and God blesses.
