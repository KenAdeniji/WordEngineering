I found out, yesterday evening, 2020-10-21, paying fares resumed, yesterday,
that my Regional Transit Connection Clipper Card expired on 2020-09-30.
 
This was when I tried to ride the AC Transit route 210 bus from
the intersection of Paseo Padre Parkway and Fremont Boulevard
to Starbucks Coffee, 32340 Alvarado Boulevard, Alvarado Place 32200-32340 Alvarado Road, 
the intersection of Alvarado Road and Galaxy Drive.	Union City, California (CA) 94587-4034.

Please kindly complete the form and send it to me by postal mail to my residential address.

Co-incidentally, Microsoft Windows Explorer, search, 
did not find records of previous e-mail files, to
Alameda County Health Agency Care Services Tri-City Community Support Center Behavioral Health Care Services.

Thank you and God blesses.
