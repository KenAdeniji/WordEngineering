2020-10-26T10:34:00	I spoke to a member of your staff, Melinda, at the South Center of your building. To ascertain where our differences remain?
2020-10-26T10:34:00	Melinda invited me to the waiting room, and later gave me the Regional Transit Connection Discount ID Card Program Renewal Application

At Lake Merritt BART Station, I was told, that my doctor and I, need to complete the Medical Certification Form, saying, You are not permanent.

2020-10-26T13:05:00	Melinda invited me to the waiting room, I completed my part of the Medical Certification Form.
2020-10-26T13:45:00 Betty A. attended to me and she said doctor Dennis O'Brien will telephone me.



Thank you and God blesses.
