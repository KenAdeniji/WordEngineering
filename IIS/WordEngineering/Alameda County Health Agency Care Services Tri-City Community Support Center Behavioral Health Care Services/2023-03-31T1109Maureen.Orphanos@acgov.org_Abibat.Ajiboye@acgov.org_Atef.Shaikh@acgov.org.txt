Hi Ken, how are you doing?
How have you been, since we last spoke?
We started and stopped your medication.
Is this 5mg or 10mg?
Do you have the bottle with you?
You have a few medication could you tell me which one you are taking?
	Fluphenazine 5mg tablet.
Tell me a little bit about yourself?
Have you noticed a difference?
Can you share with me how you have been feeling?
How did you come to the appointment, today? I rode the bus.
And, where did you ride the bus from?
Are you getting through the day? And, what kind of thing you want to work on?
What can I do for you?
Do you feel content with your life?
To share your story with me.
Dani shared information about your brothers.
I will like to speak to your brothers to help better understand.
Would it be okay signing a release of information?
I am going to call your brothers.
Are you feeling tired in the morning?
We can continue with 2mg at bedtime.
The medication given to me is what I take.
