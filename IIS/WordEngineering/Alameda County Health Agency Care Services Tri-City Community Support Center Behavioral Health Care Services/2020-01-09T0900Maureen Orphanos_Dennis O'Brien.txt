I visited with doctor Dennis O'Brien on 2020-01-09T09:00:00.

My next visit with doctor Dennis O'Brien is on 2020-03-09T09:00:00.

Doctor Dennis O'Brien, said, we are conducting an annual review, and the questions, asked, were the following:

	When is your date of birth?
	Over the past year, have you been feeling okay?
	Any problem with the medication?
	Do you work, outside the home?
	Have you been sleeping okay?
	Tell me, what has been going on, that is positive?
	Anything you want to talk about?
	I want to re-new your medication?
	Do you know the name of the medicine, you take?
	You pick your medication from CVS?
	How far in school, did you complete?

	Found out that Microsoft Windows Explorer lost this file, it no longer lists this file.
	I recovered the file content from Microsoft SQL Server relational database.
