advised me to draw a monthly salary of three thousand Australian dollars (AUD) .

At IGT, I earned seventy Australian dollars an hour; 
at Reel.com, I earned ninety United States dollars (USD) an hour.

When I started out at IDS, I was at 30,000, annually; and it was raised to 35,000, annually.

At Wilson Market Research, I earned, 45,000.
