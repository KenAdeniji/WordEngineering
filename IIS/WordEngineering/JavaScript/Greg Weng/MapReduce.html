Since ECMAScript 5.1, Array.prototype.map & Array.prototype.reduce were introduced to major browsers. These two functions not only allow developers to describe a computation more clearly, but also to simplify the work of writing loops for traversing an array; especially when the looping code actually is for mapping the array to a new array, or for the accumulation, checksum, and other similar reducing operations.
Left: using ordinary loop; Right: using map & reduce

Map/Reduce

Map actually means to compute things with the original array without doing structural changes to the output. For example, when map receives an array, you can make sure the output will be another array, and the only difference is that the elements inside it may be transformed from the original value/type to another value/type. So we can say the doMap function from the above example comes with the following type signature:

doMap signature

The signature reveals that [Number] means this is an array of numbers. So we now can read the signature as:

    doMap is a function, which would turn an array of numbers to an array of booleans

On the other hand, the reducing operation means we may change the structure of the input data type to a new one. For example, the signature of the doReduce is:

doReduce signature

Here, the Array of [Number] is gone. So we can see the major difference between map and reduce1.
