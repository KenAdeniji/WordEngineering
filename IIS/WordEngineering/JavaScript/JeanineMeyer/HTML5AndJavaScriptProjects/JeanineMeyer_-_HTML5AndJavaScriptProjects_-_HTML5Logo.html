needed to be occupied while awaiting the birth of her granddaughter (see
Chapter 2). Family members also are documented in Chapters 3, 5, and 8. She
continues to enjoy doing crossword puzzles and ken ken, knitting and
crocheting, reading novels and history, gardening, eating Aviva’s extraordinary cooking, listening to her

writer for progressive causes and candidates.
