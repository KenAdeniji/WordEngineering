			/*
When a property is first added to an object, JavaScript uses an internal method called
[[Put]] on the object. The [[Put]] method creates a spot in the object to store the property.
You can compare this to adding a key to a hash table for the first time. This operation specifies not just
the initial value, but also some attributes of the property. So, in the previous example, when the
name and age properties are first defined on each object, the [[Put]] method is invoked for each.
The result of calling [[Put]] is the creation of an own property on the object. An own property simply indicates 
that the specific instance of the object owns that property. The property is stored directly on the instance,
and all operations on the property must be performed through that object. 			
			*/
			/*
			When a new value is assigned to an existing property, a
separate operation called [[Set]] takes place. This operation replaces the current value
of the property with the new one.
			*/
			var person1 = { name: "Nicholas" };
			person1.age	= "Redacted";
			person1.name = "Greg";
			
			var person2 = new Object ();
			person2.name = "Nicholas";
			person2.age = "Redacted";
			person2.name = "Michael";

			/*
			The in operator looks for a property with a given name in a specific
object and returns true if it finds it. In effect, the in
operator checks to see if the given key exists in the hash table. For example, here’s what happens
when in is used to check for some properties in the person1 object
			*/
			console.log("name" in person1);

			/*
			In some cases, however, you might want to check for the existence of
a property only if it is an own property. The in operator checks for both
own properties and prototype properties, so you’ll need to take a different
approach. Enter the hasOwnProperty() method, which is present on all objects
and returns true only if the given property exists and is an own property.
For example, the following code compares the results of using
in versus hasOwnProperty() on different properties in person1:
			*/
			var person1 = {name:"Nicholas", sayName: function() { console.log(this.name); }};
			console.log("name" in person1); // true
			console.log(person1.hasOwnProperty("name")); // true
			console.log("toString" in person1); // true
			console.log(person1.hasOwnProperty("toString")); // false			

			/*
			Removing Properties
Just as properties can be added to objects at any time, they can also be
removed. Simply setting a property to null doesn’t actually remove the
property completely from the object, though. Such an operation calls
[[Set]] with a value of null, which, as you saw earlier in the chapter, only
replaces the value of the property. You need to use the delete
operator to completely remove a property from an object.
The delete operator works on a single object property and calls an
internal operation named [[Delete]]
. You can think of this operation as removing a key/value pair from a hash table. When the
delete operator is successful, it returns true. (Some properties can’t be removed, and this is
discussed in more detail later in the chapter.)
			*/
			var person1 = {name:"Nicholas"};
			console.log("name" in person1); // true
			delete person1.name; // true - not output
			console.log("name" in person1); // false
			console.log(person1.name); // undefined
			
			/*
			Enumeration By default, all properties that you add to an object are
enumerable, which means that you can iterate over them using a for-in
loop. Enumerable properties have their internal
[[Enumerable]] attributes set to true. The
for-in loop enumerates all enumerable properties on an object, assigning
the property name to a variable. For example, the following loop out
- puts the property names and values of an object:

var property; for (property in object) {
console.log("Name: " + property);
console.log("Value: " + object[property]);
}
Each time through the for-in loop, the property variable is filled with
the next enumerable property on the object until all such properties have
been used. At that point, the loop is finished and code execution continues. 
This example uses bracket notation to retrieve the value of the object
property and output it to the console, which is one of the primary use
cases for bracket notation in JavaScript.
If you just need a list of an object’s properties to use later in your program, 
ECMAScript 5 introduced the Object.keys() method to retrieve an array of enumerable property names, as shown here:

var properties = Object.keys(object);
// if you want to mimic for-in behavior
var i, len;
for (i = 0, len=properties.length; i < len; i++){
console.log("Name: " + properties[i]);
console.log("Value: " + object[properties[i]]);
}
This example uses Object.keys() to retrieve the enumerable properties
from an object. A for loop is then used to iterate over the properties
and output the name and value. Typically, you would use Object.keys()
in situations where you want to operate on an array of property names and
for-in when you don’t need an array.

There is a difference between the enumerable properties returned in a
for-in loop and the ones returned by Object.keys(). The for-in 
loop also enumerates prototype properties, while Object.keys() returns only own (instance) properties.
