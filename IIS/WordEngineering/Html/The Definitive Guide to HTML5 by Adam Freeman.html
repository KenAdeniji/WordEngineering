<body> 
<b>The b element is used to offset a span of text without indicating any extra emphasis or importance. The 
examples given in the HTML5 specification are keywords in a document abstract and product names in 
a review.</b><br/>
<em>The element represents a span of text with emphatic stress.</em><br/>
<i>The i element denotes a span of text that has a different nature from the surrounding content. This is a 
fairly loose definition, but common examples include words from other languages, a technical or 
scientific term, and even a person's thoughts (as opposed to speech).</i><br/>
<s>You use the s element to denote a span of text that is no longer correct or accurate. The style convention 
is to display the text with a line drawn through it.</s><br/>
<strong>Strong</strong>Eating too many oranges can give you heart burn.<br/>
<u>The element offsets a span of text from the surrounding content without implying any increased 
importance or emphasis. This is a vague description because the element previously had a 
presentational impact only (to underline text) and no real semantic significance. In effect, this is still a 
presentational element and the effect it has is to underline text (although you could potentially change 
this behavior using CSS, I don't recommend repurposing elements in this way; look at using the span
element instead).</u><br/>
<small>The small element denotes fine print and is often used for disclaimers and clarifications.</small><br/>
Subscript h<sub>2</sub>O.<br/>
Superscript x<sup>2</sup> exponential.<br/>
Line break<br/>
With the wbr element, the browser is able to treat the very long word as a series of smaller segments, 
and can wrap the content more elegantly. When you use the wbr element, you are telling the browser 
where breaking a word would be most appropriate. 
This is a very long word: Super<wbr>califragilistic<wbr>expialidocious.<br/>
<code>Denotes a fragment of computer code.</code><br/>
<var>Denotes a variable in a programming context or a 
placeholder for the reader to mentally insert a 
specific value.</var><br/>
<samp>Denotes output from a program or computer system.</samp><br/>
<kbd>Denotes user input.</kbd><br/>

The span element has no meaning in its own right. You would use it to apply one of the global attributes 
to a region of content.
I like <span class="fruit">apples</span>and <span class="fruit">oranges</span>.<br/>
Homophones are words which are pronounced the same, but have different spellings 
and meanings.

as <i>citrus reticulata</i>.</p>
<div>
The div element doesn't have a specific meaning. You use it to create structure and give meaning to 
content when the other HTML elements are insufficient. You add this meaning by applying the global 
attributes (described in Chapter 3), typically the class or id attributes.
</div>
<pre><code> 
var fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "mangoes", "cherries"]; 
for (var i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) { 
document.writeln("I like " + fruits[i]); 
} 
</code></pre>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple"> 
The apple forms a tree that is small and deciduous, reaching 3 to 12 metres 
(9.8 to 39 ft) tall, with a broad, often densely twiggy crown. 
The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals 5 to 12 cm long and 3–6 
centimetres (1.2–2.4 in) broad on a 2 to 5 centimetres (0.79 to 2.0 in) petiole 
with an acute tip, serrated margin and a slightly downy underside. Blossoms are 
produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves. 
The flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, 
and 2.5 to 3.5 centimetres (0.98 to 1.4 in) in diameter. 
The fruit matures in autumn, and is typically 5 to 9 centimetres ( 
2.0 to 3.5 in) in diameter. 
The center of the fruit contains five carpels arranged in a five-point star, 
each carpel containing one to three seeds, called pips.</blockquote>
<hr/>
The hr element represents a paragraph-level thematic break. This is another oddly specified term that 
arises from the need to separate semantics from presentation. In HTML4, the hr element represented a 
horizontal rule (literally a line across the page). In HTML5, the hr element represents a transition to a 
separate, but related, topic. The style convention in HTML5 is a line across the page.

i  Lowercase Roman characters  i., ii., iii., iv. 
I  Uppercase Roman characters  I., II., III., IV. 
If the reversed attribute is defined, then the list is numbered in descending order. However, as I 
write this, none of the mainstream browsers implement the reversed attribute.

You use the ul element to denote unordered lists. As with the ol element, items in the ul element are 
denoted using the li element, which is described next.

The li element denotes an item in a list. You can use it with the ul, ol, and menu elements (the menu
element is not yet supported in the main stream browsers).

<li>bananas</li> 
<li value="4">mangoes</li>

The article element represents a self-contained piece of content in an HTML document that could, in 
principle, be distributed or used independently from the rest of the page (such as through an RSS feed). 
That's not to say you have to distribute it independently, just that independence is the guidance for 
when to use this element.<br/>

The aside element denotes content that is only tangentially related to the surrounding element. This is 
similar to a sidebar in a book or magazine. The content has something to do with the rest of the page, 
article, or section, but it isn't part of the main flow. It could be some additional background, a set of 
links to related articles, and so on.<br/>

When the address element is a descendant of an article element, it is assumed to provide contact 
information for that article. Otherwise, when an address element is a child of a body element (and there 
is no article element between the body and address elements), the address is assumed to provide 
contact information for the entire document. 
The address element must not be used to denote addresses that are not contact information for a 
document or article. For example, you can’t use this element to denote addresses of customers or users 
in the content of a document. Listing 10-9 shows the address element in use.<br/>

The details element creates a section of the document that the user can expand to get further details 
about a topic.

The details element usually contains a summary element, which creates a label or title for the details 
section.

Most tables are straightforward grids, where each cell occupies one position in the grid. However, to 
represent more complicated data, you sometimes need to create irregular tables, where cells are spread 
across multiple rows and columns. You create such tables using the colspan and rowspan attributes of 
the td and th elements.

caption { display: table-caption; text-align: center; }
<table border="1">

	<tr>
		<td>Cell.</td>
