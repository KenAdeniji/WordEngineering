Block, inline, and inline-block

With respect to layout, the display property has three values you should be most concerned with. Here are the main differences between how these three display types get laid out:

block
    My width is sized by my parent and I can have widths and heights set on me. My height is determined by my content.
inline
    My width and height are determined by my contents and widths and heights donâ€™t do anything to me. Think of me like a word flowing in a paragraph.
inline-block
    I am the same as block except my width is determined by my contents.

<style>
* {
    background: #eee;
    border: .125em solid;
    margin-bottom: .5em;
    padding: .5em
}
</style>
<body>
	<div style="{display: block;}">div style="{display: block;}"</div>
	<div style="{display: block;}">div style="{display: block;}"</div>
	<span style="{display: inline;}">span style="{display: inline;}"</span>
	<span style="{display: inline;}">span style="{display: inline;}"</span>
	<div style="{display: inline-block;}">div style="{display: inline-block;}"</div>
	<div style="{display: inline-block;}">div style="{display: inline-block;}"</div>
</body>
