			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville_Revival">The Brownsville Revival (also known as the Pensacola Outpouring)</a>
			was a widely reported Christian revival within the Pentecostal movement that began on Father's Day June 18, 1995, at Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida. Characteristics of the Brownsville Revival movement, as with other Christian religious revivals, included acts of repentance by parishioners and a call to holiness, inspired by the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. Some of the occurrences in this revival fit the description of moments of religious ecstasy. More than four million people are reported to have attended the revival meetings from its beginnings in 1995 to around 2000.

			An event had just commenced. Bill Gates stood in the center-west, and Bill Gates said he has to help with carrying water. The hall room was lighted, and people carried water northward on the east aisle. I saw a man on a wheel chair. My twin sibling showed me that by x co-ordinate, and y co-ordinate writing points, these are instructions for drawing the image of a person. A Yoruba named player was drawn.
