Hackers
Heroes of the Computer Revolution - 25th Anniversary Edition
By Steven Levy
published 2010-05-19

http://stevenlevy.com
This
 25th anniversary edition of Steven Levy's classic book traces the 
exploits of the computer revolution's original hackers -- those 
brilliant and eccentric nerds from the late 1950s through the early '80s
 who took risks, bent the rules, and pushed the world in a radical new 
direction. With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill 
Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, Hackers is a
 fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads
 to the first home computers.
Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and 
unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared
 sense of values, known as "the hacker ethic," that still thrives today.
 Hackers captures a seminal period in recent history when underground 
activities blazed a trail for today's digital world, from MIT students 
finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture 
that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.
