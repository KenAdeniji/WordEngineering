In this interview Juval LÃ¶wy shares what motivated him to write his new bestseller, Righting Software.
Juval explains the classic design mistake with most systems, that is, designing against the requirement, which always ends up in disaster when requirements change.
Juval explains that it is quite possible to architect software systems that are good essentially forever, using what he calls volatility-based decomposition.
Juval then discusses his approach for providing the required behavior of the system, what he calls composable design. 
While this is a new idea in software system design, it is a universal design principle of all good systems, and it is the essence of the agility all businesses crave.

Never design against requirement
Identify core use-cases
Identify building blocks
