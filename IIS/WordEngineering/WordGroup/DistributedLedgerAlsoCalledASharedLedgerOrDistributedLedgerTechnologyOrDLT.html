I graduated with a Masters Degree in Computer Information Science, in 1995. My first thesis was on Distributed Databases, and final thesis was on Client/Server, largely using Sybase and Watcom SQL Anywhere, as it corresponded with my role Powersoft Australia, first consultant.
In most of my consulting roles, I have done replication, migration, and load balancing.
My doctorate thesis was on smart card and flash memory.
When you say, data bandwidth? What is the nearest to solution? Where do you keep sensitive data? Where do you share work? With cloud computing, where do we rest?
My own experience, is knowledge, I say use. With video, do you compete with YouTube? I once read an article saying that Google is dead when Big Data demise to blockchain.
For the last 30 years, I have worked with banks,  financial market, and accounting.
I have exposure to SQL and No/SQL.
When do I die? I submit.
I don't need to generate fund; but what is the purpose of business?
A SOHO friend, ex PeopleSoft employee, once said, he builds websites with XML communication to firms, for a share of their business.
You say, this German technology, you will adapt to the American market.
I have adapted the Bible, to my own saying.
What do I, want to gain? To realize, where I am fully used.
What tries my own?
My doctorate research is using the Bible, as a human example.
As a resource, for my own guidance.
I am not a writer, but I am computer trained.
