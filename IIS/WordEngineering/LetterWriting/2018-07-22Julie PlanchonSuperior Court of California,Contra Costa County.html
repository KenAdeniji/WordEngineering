			2018-07-22T00:00:00 Thank you letter
			</a><br/>
			
			I am grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to interview for the architect 
			position at 2018-07-20T08:30:00.
			I found the practical examination interesting and stimulating.
			The oral conversation was rewarding and enlightening.
			
			I use this opportuning to wish the interviewers a kind rehearsal,
			in their future endeavor, as they have given me.
			
			I may not be the chosen candidate; that is appropriate as use.
			
			To determine the course of history, is to see the course ahead of you.
			
			Once a better person, that is all I know.
			
			A companion in end, is a companion in the beginning.

			Only an infant, grow approximately.
			Schema SMO coupled with DDL versus select from system views?
			To know, I am doing what I am made for; is approximately made in me.
			
			To you, there is a picture of Christ; and that I am reminded of.
