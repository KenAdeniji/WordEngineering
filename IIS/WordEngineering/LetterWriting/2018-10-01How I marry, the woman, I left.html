			Pauline Beshay, her female friend, Stance and I, met at Westfield Parramatta.
			Pauline was more vocal, attentive and interested, in pursuing a relationship.
			But I conceded Pauline to Stance, since Stance is taller than I am.
			I called Pauline's female friend once, but she didn't show enthusiasm.
			So I didn't call her, again.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pauline is tall and Pauline plays basketball, but when you don't turn professional, this is not lucrative.
			Pauline looked forward to having a family of her own, and Pauline studied child care in college.
		</p>
		<p>
			The choice? Are made above us.
			The attentiveness of tomorrow, cares for today. Australia, locality, Rome phase II, America.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is up to God, to divide the individual in people.
			It is easy to express, what I know.
			Between us?
			I thank Pauline for letting me get over Genevieve Tarzer, Anita Cachia, and Jodie Hall.
			The associate of being.
			What I am realizing for a people, is the certaincy of time.
