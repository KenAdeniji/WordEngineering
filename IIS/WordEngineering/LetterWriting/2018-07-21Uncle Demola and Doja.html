			I thank the two of you, for visiting between 2018-07-13 and 2018-07-19.
			
			A upper hand, is a guiding hand.
			
			What will happen to Doja, if there is no, holding hand?
			
			Having a degree, where do I, live my best?
			
			Doja grew up with her paternal uncle and his family, now that he is dead.

			The connection, are past.
			
			Where does the mirage live now?
			
			Benitoluwa suggested that I write to Kanyinsola, apostle Paul wrote to the churches,
			
			and final book of the Bible, Revelation contains letter to the seven churches.
			
			Where I belong, is where I have chosen?
			
			Once a part, always preluding.
			
			I have children, I have grown.
			
			Could we imagine life, apart from Him, separated of Him?
			
			Enjoy being with each other.
