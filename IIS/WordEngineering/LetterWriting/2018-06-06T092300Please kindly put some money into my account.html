		<p>
			2018-06-04 At Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station, I attempted several times, 
			to use my bank card to increase the amount of deposit on my Clipper card, 
			without success; the attendant finally said,
			there is probably insufficient fund in my bank account; therefore,
			I placed twenty dollars cash on my Clipper card.
		</p>
		<p>
			2018-06-05 I transferred one hundred dollars from my savings account to
			my checking account; there remains a balance of fifty dollars on
			my savings account.

			Thank you, and God blesses.
