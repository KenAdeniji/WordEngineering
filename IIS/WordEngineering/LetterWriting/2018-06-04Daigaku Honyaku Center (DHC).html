			My first contact with <a href="http://www.DHCCare.com">DHC</a> 
			occurred on 2007-06-14, when I was interviewed by 
			Jaroslaw Kazberuk, Jarek, the Lead Programmer.
		</p>
		<p>
			The programmers at DHC were developing their order processing application
			using Microsoft FoxPro, and had transistion to Microsoft SQL Server
			relational database.
		</p>
		<p>
			I started work on 2007-06-25, and I had three months to develop
			a proof-of-concept Intranet that will facilitate
			customer search and maintenance.
			The chosen technology was Microsoft's .NET Framework, ASP.NET, and C#.
			DHC parted ways on 2008-03-14.

			Setbacks:<br/>
			<ol>
				<li>
					I was unaware of 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">Language Integrated Query (Linq)</a>;
					therefore, I was hand-coding all database related queries.
				</li>
				<li>
					My
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</a>;
					interest was limited; hence, the user interface (UI) was poor.
				</li>
				<li>
					I had insufficient knowledge of
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Javascript</a>
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (Ajax)</a>
					and Document Object Model (DOM);
					I could render to the GridView and that was all.
				</li>
				<li>
					Microsoft was making the switch to Models Views Controllers (MVC).
					In summary, my ASP.NET web forms server-side background, was being abandoned by Microsoft.
				</li>
				<li>
					I needed education on case-studies of previous migration from FoxPro to .NET,
					order processing, why Microsoft was ceasing support of FoxPro,
					and Microsoft future direction on the Internet.
					I also did not embrace FoxPro user groups.
				</li>

			With web services, I could still depend on, and strengthen,
			my application logic, built using C#.
