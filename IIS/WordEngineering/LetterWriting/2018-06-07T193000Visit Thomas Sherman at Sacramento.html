			Twin sibling mentioned to me,
			that he is planning to visit Ingram Hood, this weekend.

			I called twin sibling, to say, that I will like to visit Thomas Sherman.

			I called Joyce Sherman, to say, that I will like to visit Thomas Sherman,
			and she encourages this, and affirms it is okay, but said 
			Thomas Sherman is in a facility.
			
			Joyce Sherman's e-mail address is
			<a href="mailto:TSherJo66@GMail.com">TSherJo66@GMail.com</a>, and
			Joyce Sherman's phone number 
			<a href="tel:+14087182297">(408) 718-2297</a>.
			
			Ingram Hood's e-mail address is
			<a href="mailto:HoodIngram@Yahoo.com">HoodIngram@Yahoo.com</a>, and
			Ingram Hood's phone number 
			<a href="tel:+19166702802">(916) 670-2802</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Joyce Sherman, Ingram Hood, and twin sibling,
			please arrange for me to see Thomas Sherman.
			I can either ride with twin sibling to Sacramento, or 
			I could take the 
			<a href="http://www.amtrak.com">Amtrak train</a>.
			The only thing outstanding is how I get to the facility
			hosting Thomas Sherman?
