2018-10-21 On my way to the Barnes & Noble Bookstore, Regal Hacienda Crossings Stadium 20 & IMAX, 4972 Dublin Boulevard. Dublin, California (CA) 94568. I boarded the train at Union City BART Station. As we approached the Bayfair BART Station, it was announced that a train is waiting for transfers at the Bayfair BART Station. When we got to Bayfair, the train door did not open, and eventually the Dublin/Pleasanton train left, and I decided to return home; therefore, I put my BART ticket at the Union City BART Station, twice, going and coming, without exiting at another BART Station.
