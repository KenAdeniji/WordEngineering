			I have been following 
			<a href="http://www.KHouse.org">Chuck Missler of Koinonia House</a>,
			since 1998, when I lived at Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
			I found out about him, on the web, and I read his Christian articles.
			I have found his prophetic insight, very outstanding.
			At that time, Chuck Missler introduced me to 
			<a href="http://www.WhatSaithTheScripture.com/Voice/The.Coming.Prince.html">The Coming Prince</a>
			by 
			sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anderson_(Scotland_Yard_official)">Robert Anderson</a>;
			and the work of 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Panin">Ivan Panin</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Every Monday morning, I would listen to Chuck Missler's audio broadcast on the Internet;
			and later in the week, I would scorch for his material on the web.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was Chuck Missler that introduced me to
			doctor <a href="http://www.alienencounters.com">Mark Eastman</a>;
			<a href="http://www.prophecyhouse.com">The Antichrist and a Cup of Tea</a> by Tim Cohen;
			<a href="http://www.geraldschroeder.com">Gerald Schroeder</a>;				
			<a href="http://www.crossroad.to/Books/BraveNewSchools/Contents.html">Brave New Schools</a> 
			by Berit Kjos;
			The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism by Andrew Bacevich;
			<a href="http://www.setterfield.org">Barry Setterfield</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For extending, his future; I am parallelly his.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am also grateful for Nancy Missler of 
			<a href="http://www.kingshighway.org">The King's High Way Ministries</a>,
			the author of Faith in the Night Seasons.
			Is one not appease, with the season.
