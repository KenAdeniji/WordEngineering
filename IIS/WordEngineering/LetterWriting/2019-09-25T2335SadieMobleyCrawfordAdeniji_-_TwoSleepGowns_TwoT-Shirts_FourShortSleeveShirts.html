			Daddy gave me the two bags, last week, Thursday or Friday.
			I asked him, what was in it, and daddy said, sleep gowns.

			When I arrived from Atlanta, Georgia; I gave one bag
			to Daniel, and I opened the other bag.
			I was surprised, to see that you sent not only
			not sleep gowns, but shirts, as well.
			I also telephoned daddy, to find out,
 			how I should express my appreciation.

			Daddy telephoned, and said that
			I may send e-mail, and telephone;
			but it is harder to get you via the telephone.

			God making man; fully used Himself
			(
				Genesis 2:5-7
			).
			During creation,
			the Bible used the phrase, He said;
			but when making man, He formed.
