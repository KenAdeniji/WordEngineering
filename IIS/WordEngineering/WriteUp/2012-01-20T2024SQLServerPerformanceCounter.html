	Use PerfMon to monitor SQLServer's performance counter.
	<ol>
	<li>The Network Interface - Bytes Total/sec, should be less than 50% of the available bandwidth.</li>
	<li>The Memory Manager - Total Server Memory, is the memory used in kilobytes, if this value exceeds the amount of physical memory, then add more memory.</li>
	<li>The PhysicalDisk - Average Disk Queue Length, is the amount of requests that are waiting for disk access. This number should not exceed, twice the number of spindles, that make-up the physical disk drives. If it is so, then use faster drives, or add additional disk drives.</li>
	<li>The Cache Manager - Cache Hit Ratio, says whether SQL Server can read your queries out of the procedure cache. A possible solution is to add additional RAM, or to optimize your query.</li>
	<li>The Buffer Manager - Buffer Cache Hit Ratio, is how often, SQL Server can read data out of the cache.</li>
	<li>The Processor - % Processor Time, is the percentage of CPU utilization.</li>
	</ol>
