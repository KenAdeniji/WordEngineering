			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>
				This doctorate research project, is an attempt to find the man, we are meant to be.
				The Bible, specifically King James Version (KJV), will be studied, to broaden, our scope of 
				knowledge.<br>
				
				The problems we will address, include, the rules, changing man.<br>
				
				The method of solving these problems are scripture reading, modelling, 
				object oriented programming, relational database, and artificial intelligence.
				
				The conclusion reached, is that man is made, in the image of God, and he will succumb to Him.
				Man at a compassionate end, in composing his future.
				The design effort, is to appreciate.
				Half of you, I made up. Half for Me (Genesis 2:7, Genesis 2:22-23).

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				What is the topic and why is it important? State the problem(s) as simply as you can.
				
				What led man to his understanding, and how can we further, his interest?
				Are we participating as individual, or as central human being?
				How do we lead, and do we gain submission to others?
				I hear an open view, is it consensus?

			<h2>Literature review</h2>
			<p>
			</p>	
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
			<p>
				The Bible is a substantive work, on how-to live a modern life. The author believes, that by
				following the orders, lived in the Bible, he can gain an understanding, on how-to live life,
				according to God's commandments.
				
				Man has a life time, to abide by God's will.
				
				The Bible is the central authority, that will guide, this research work.
				The author has practised as a programmer for the last quarter of a century; and there
				is not much in-depth work of software development, envisaged for this research work.
				Much of the effort, will go into translating the biblical verse, into model, and it 
				is hoped, this design can then be tuned into computer language programming.
			</p>	
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Theory</h2>
			<p>
			  To start off, the author assume, that he will have to read the entire Bible, and find
			  cases, where God has led man. However, this will be laborious, and will cover a lot of
			  information overload, that may be unnecessary. Therefore, a computer program, earlier 
			  written by the author that will list the first, last, and number of occurrences of the term, 
			  lead, was consulted. A table, was created in a relational database to store the initial
			  entries.
			</p>
			<p>
			  At this stage of the game, it is unknown, how valuable this will be, reading data in a
			  document is easier than getting information off a database. We will show the table
			  schema, data definition language, and meta data (data about data). This may be useful
			  for the people, that are database literate, and will like an expedition in this matter.
			  Programmers may also like to read information from the database, in their constructs,
			  and we will make room for this. For the non-too computer literate, we will break
			  information down into easy to read, English grammar.

			<p>
				After the books of Moses, Pentateuch, the other books, including Judges, Samuel, 1 Kings, 
				2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, and 2 Chronicles, mainly deal with royal leaders. The books by the
				major and minor prophets detail spiritual leaders. The New Testament was mainly written by
				the disciples, and Paul; except the first three Gospels, and Acts.
			</p>
			<p>	
				In the Old Testament, leaders are chosen. 
				These include the selection of judges (Exodus 18:13-27), the first census (Numbers 1:4),
				and the sending out of spies (Numbers 13:2-3).
			</p>
			<p>
				In the New Testament, our LORD, Jesus Christ, selected twelve disciples, 
				to follow Him (Matthew 10:1). These disciples, continued His ministry, 
				after our LORD had departed. An additional seven workers, were selected
				including Stephen (Acts 6).
				
				In the early days, of Christianity, the faith was referred to as "the way"
				(Genesis 6:12).
			</p>
			<p>
				After God, had implicitly, given man authority, over the beast of the earth,
				He asked man, to guide Himself 
				(Genesis 4:7, Exodus 4:9, Exodus 7:17-25, Exodus 12, Genesis 3:7, Genesis 3:21).
				I am reminded of the past, as I seek the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first occurrence of the word, lead, in the Bible, occurs in Genesis 33:14;
				when Israel explains to his twin brother, Esau, that his children and cattle, 
				should be driven carefully, less they die (Genesis 33:8-16, Genesis 1:24-31).
				In both cases, God has made man, sovereign over his flock and dependant.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Exodus experience, God used two different types of light, cloud and fire, 
				to lead the Jews
				(Exodus 13:21-22, Genesis 1:14-19, Genesis 37:9).
			</p>
			<p>
				The Egyptians supposedly fell into the sea, like lead
				(Exodus 15:10).
			</p>
			<p>
				The first association of man, and the word, lead, occurs, when God directed
				Moses, to lead the people to the Promised Land
				(Exodus 32:34, Exodus 2:14, Exodus 3:1).
			</p>
			<p>
				Prior to the passing away of Moses, Moses asked the LORD to elect a successor;
				therefore, there will be a earthly leader for God's people.
				He directs our flow, according to His end
				(Numbers 27:17, Acts 1:15-26, 1 Samuel 8).
			</p>
			<p>
				Moses says that the LORD will lead the Israelites out, if they disobey
				God's commandment (Deuteronomy 4:27)
			</p>
			<p>
				Moses says the priests, officers, can select, captains of armies to lead
				the people. Samuel anointed Saul and David, respectively
				(Deuteronomy 20:9, 1 Samuel 10:1, 1 Samuel 15:1, 1 Samuel 15:17, 1 Samuel 16:13, 1 Chronicles 11:3).
			</p>
			<p>
				Moses promises misery, to the disobedient (Deuteronomy 28:37).
			</p>
			<p>
				Jacob knew only one God; and Him only, Jacob served
				(Deuteronomy 32:12).
			</p>
			<p>
				Deborah and Barak sang a song to lead captivity captive (Judges 5:12). 
			</p>
			<p>
				When it was time to divide the spoil, the men of Belial, felt that the people
				that did not go to war, should not be given their dues. But David dissuade this
				(1 Samuel 30:22).
			</p>
			<p>
				Jehoiada, the leader of the Aaronites, had three thousand and seven hundred warriors
				(1 Chronicles 12:27).
			</p>
			<p>
				David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, the priests and Levites,
				prior to returning the ark
				(1 Chronicles 13:1).
			</p>
			<p>
				Hezekiah promises that if the people turn to God, that the captors will show compassion
				towards the captives, let them return to the land
				(2 Chronicles 30:9).
			</p>
			<p>
				A leader, may sign covenant with people. This may be entirely up-to the leader 
				to fulfill, or it may be a bi-partisan agreement
				(Genesis 6:18).
			</p>
			<p>
				Equally, have I traded Myself, as the last place; that I may seem, the first place
				(Psalms 68:18, Ephesians 4:8-10, Romans 10:6-7).
			</p>
			<p>
				Making me, rewarding Him. 
				Our trials, will make a way for the future; as we make a way, for the present.
				Presently, I am need of a Christ; lastly, I am in need, of a place.
				I have separated you, from the past; that I may see you, in the future
				(Luke 4:1-21, Matthew 6:13, Luke 11:4).
			</p>
			<p>
				When I know you, I know you, as a self representation of Me.
				(Exodus 32:34, Genesis 22:1-18, Genesis 24, Genesis 12:1, Genesis 20:13, Genesis 24:7, Genesis 24:23, Genesis 24:38, Genesis 24:40).
				This is the familiarization, I have breed for the ages (Genesis 7:2).
			</p>
			<p>
				This is my limitation, of my perseverance
				(Numbers 27:17).
			</p>
			<p>
				Teach, as I become
				(Genesis 18:17-19).
			</p>	

			<p>
				To this trace, we have made you realize, we are the same, as firm.

				When you look, at a leader's contribution or potential.
				You may gauge his height, physical stature.
				
				I see heaven, and it sums up men.
				
				I have made You, dearest to me; that I may seem, nearest to You.
