					This is bringing the world of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing to our research. Bible is a static database; and new records are added to WordEngineering, daily. The census offers the opportunity to compare the count at both times when the men of war were counted, we are interested in seeing growth or dip, and determining the total number of warriors. This is similar to the seal at Revelation, but the count, seal, is always 12,000 for each tribe, and total sealed is 144,000 (Revelation 7:1-8). Also the total is not tallied, previously (Numbers 1, 26). Fully ahead, is the substancy, of the view.
