of Science.

## Abstract {#Abstract}

**Thesis Statement:** This dissertation introduces
[AlphabetSequence](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html)
( [2 Corinthians
10:9-18](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=2%20Corinthians%2010:9-18){datetime="2022-01-07T09:08:00"
word="That create." hiswordid="144962" contactid="11433"} ). The
AlphabetSequenceIndex is the [result of a pure function to sum alphabet
places]{datetime="2020-09-09T00:00:00"}
[AlphabetSequence.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/InformationInTransit/ProcessLogic/AlphabetSequence.cs)
. [ The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference are the offsets from the
beginning and the ending of the Scripture.
]{datetime="2020-09-14T00:00:00"} [ The
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference consists of four parts; there
are two references each to particular chapters and verses. The first
mention is the forward verse, which the author calculates by determining
the AlphabetSequenceIndex verse in the Bible. The second mention is the
forward chapter, and this the author calculates as before, but by
substituting the verse with the chapter. Both the backward chapter and
backward verse are the corresponding, anticlockwise places.

The issuing of this domain name may be related to commencing writing the
book titled Ocean Senior. There has not been a follow-up on future
artifacts. But when one reads the Bible, the book of Revelation, which
starts with the letters to the 7 churches in Asia Minor, does not
instigate future alteration.

### The Bible Database {#BibleDatabase}

#### The Scripture Table {#ScriptureTable}

The content of the Bible SQL Server database is principally the
Scripture table. The Scripture table has a [composite primary
key](http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/jeffs/archive/2007/08/23/composite_primary_keys.aspx)
, which consists of three columns; the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID
columns. The SQL statement
` ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT [PK_Scripture] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ( BookID ASC, ChapterID ASC, VerseID ASC ) `
is for setting the primary key.

The author proposes creating a non-unique index,
IDX_Scripture_ChapterIDSequence, on the ChapterIDSequence column.

There are varchar(MAX) columns which has the text for each Bible
version.

##### The Scripture Table\'s BookID Column {#ScriptureTableBookIDColumn}

Because there are sixty-six books in the Bible, the BookID ranges
between 1 and 66; starting from Genesis and ending at Revelation. The
SQL statement
`ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Scripture_BookID_Range CHECK (BookID BETWEEN 1 AND 66)`
will set the range restriction.

##### The Scripture Table\'s ChapterID Column {#ScriptureTableChapterIDColumn}

The ChapterID ranges between 1 and 150; the SQL statement
`SELECT MAX(ChapterID) FROM Bible..Scripture` is for determining the
upper limit. The SQL statement
`ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture WITH CHECK ADD CONSTRAINT [CK_Scripture_ChapterID_Range] CHECK (([ChapterID]>=(1) AND [ChapterID]<=(150)))`
will set the range restriction.

##### The Scripture Table\'s VerseID Column {#ScriptureTableVerseIDColumn}

The VerseID ranges between 1 and 176; the SQL statement
`SELECT MAX(VerseID) FROM Bible..Scripture` is for determining the upper
limit. The SQL statement
`ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture WITH CHECK ADD CONSTRAINT [CK_Scripture_VerseID_Range] CHECK (([VerseID]>=(1) AND [VerseID]<=(176)))`
will set the range restriction.

##### The Scripture Table\'s KingJamesVersion Column {#ScriptureTableKingJamesVersionColumn}

The author would have considered placing an index on the
KingJamesVersion column, but the author found out during his research
that the verses in the KingJamesVersion are not unique nor distinct, and
indexes are not applicable to like expressions with leading wildcards.

##### The Scripture View\'s Testament Column {#Scripture_ViewTestamentColumn}

The SQL statement `(case when BookID <=(39) then 'Old' else 'New' end)`
will set this computed column. The Testament column serves as a filter,
such as, in the
[BibleWord](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html).

##### The Scripture View\'s BookTitle Column {#Scripture_ViewBookTitleColumn}

The SQL statement `dbo.udf_BookTitle(BookID)` is for determining this
computed column. As expected, there is a correlation between the BookID
column, and and its corresponding BookTitle column, it progresses from
Genesis to Revelation. Because SQL does not support arrays, the author,
chose to write a [SQL CLR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_CLR) C#
function for determining the BookTitle, when passed the BookID.
Although, C# supports [Design by
contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract), assertions,
but the author only checks BookID range validity, and return NULL, if
the argument does not fall within this range. The author could throw
exceptions, but the author does not know the side effect nor full
ramification. Instead of writing and determining the BookTitle using C#,
an alternative is to use a database table. A table with two columns,
BookID and BookTitle, will store and make
[extractable]{datetime="2021-03-17T19:11:00"} the sixty-six books. [ For
example the beginning book of the New Testament, the 40th book, spelling
is Matthew or Mathew, double tt versus single t. An improvement on the
current implementation is to use soundex to decipher the book title and
the corresponding BookID. ]{datetime="2020-10-06T15:05:00"}

##### The Scripture Table\'s ScriptureReference Column {#ScriptureTableScriptureReferenceColumn}

The SQL statement
`dbo.udf_ScriptureReference(BookID, ChapterID, VerseID)` will calculate
the conjecture of the BookTitle, ChapterID, and VerseID. Since this is a
computed column; therefore, you can not set its [Entity
Integrity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_integrity); if it were
not; the SQL statement
`ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT uc_Scripture_ScriptureReference UNIQUE (ScriptureReference)`
will set its entity integrity. The distinction between raw data versus
computed columns is performance, space.

##### The Scripture Table\'s ChapterIDSequence Column {#ScriptureTableChapterIDSequenceColumn}

When loading data, the author decides the ChapterIDSequence column; and
increment it, every time, the BookID and ChapterID, changes during load.
The ChapterIDSequence ranges between 1 and 1189; starting from Genesis 1
and ending at Revelation 22. The SQL statement
` SELECT BookID, ChapterID FROM Bible..Scripture GROUP BY BookID, ChapterID ORDER BY BookID, ChapterID `
will decide the greatest value for ChapterIDSequence. An alternative SQL
statement
` select count( distinct cast(BookID as varchar(6)) + ' ' + cast(ChapterID as varchar(6)) ) FROM Bible..Scripture `
Another SQL statement
` ; with cte ( BookID , ChapterID ) as ( select distinct BookID, ChapterID FROM Bible..Scripture ) select cnt = count(*) from cte `
The SQL statement
` ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Scripture_ChapterIDSequence_Range CHECK (ChapterIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 1189) `
will check the range correctness. Although it is good to know the
ChapterIDSequence, but it is primarily used to decide the boundaries for
scripture reference queries.

##### The Scripture Table\'s VerseIDSequence Column {#ScriptureTableVerseIDSequenceColumn}

When loading data, the author calculates the VerseIDSequence column, and
increments it, every time, the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID changes
during the data load. There are some Bible books that have only one
chapter, such as, Obadiah, Philemon, 2 John, 3 John, Jude; therefore,
the author is careful when the choice is made to increment and update
the VerseIDSequence column. The SQL statement
` SELECT BookTitle FROM Bible..Scripture GROUP BY BookID, BookTitle HAVING MAX(ChapterID) = 1 ORDER BY BookID `
is for listing these one chapter, Bible books. The VerseIDSequence
ranges between 1 and 31102; starting from Genesis 1:1, and ending at
Revelation 22:21. The SQL statement
` SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Bible..Scripture ` will decide the greatest value
for VerseIDSequence, the total number of rows, records, in the
Bible..Scripture table. The SQL statement
` ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Scripture_VerseIDSequence_Range CHECK (VerseIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 31102) `
will do the data integrity. As said earlier, although it is good to know
the VerseIDSequence, but it is primarily used to decide the boundaries
for scripture reference queries. The identity functionality which
auto-increments, before inserting each row is useful, for ensuring this
candidate primary key, abides by the entity integrity constraint;
however, The SQL statement
` ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT AK_Scripture_VerseIDSequence UNIQUE (VerseIDSequence) `
is supplementary.

##### The Scripture_View BibleReference Column {#ScriptureTableBibleReferenceColumn}

The SQL statement
`((right('00'+CONVERT([varchar](2),[BookID],(0)),(2))+right('000'+CONVERT([varchar](3),[ChapterID],(0)),(3)))+right('000'+CONVERT([varchar](3),[VerseID],(0)),(3)))`
will combine the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID. This is a convention
for referring to Bible rows, by a unique identifier, which consists of
the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID. The leading zeros are placeholders
for blocks of IDs, such as, BookID which will have two digits, ChapterID
which will have three digits, and VerseID which will also have three
digits. It is easier, faster, and more compact to restrict and order by
numbers rather than text. Listed below, is the result set, for this SQL
statement.
` SELECT ScriptureReference, BibleReference FROM Bible..Scripture_View WHERE BookID = 43 AND ChapterID = 1 AND VerseID = 1 `

Please note, that the author has not developed this further, it is just
an introduction and speculation, which others may wish to adopt.

Most of the applications, extract information, and query the Scripture
table. If the user chooses to, he may choose to load another Bible
version, into the Scripture table and the application will still work as
usual, and there will be no need to make changes to the application;
thereby, achieving [Separation of concerns
(SoC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns).

#### The Exact Table {#ExactTable}

The
[Exact](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/Exact.html?bibleWord=KAA)
table\'s, primary task, is to tell, on the words that are in the Bible.
Its information set include each word\'s first and last scripture
reference occurrence(s), and count of occurrence(s). If the word, occurs
only once, then the last occurrence is set to null. The incentive for
writing the exact module comes from [Dave
Hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Hunt_%28Christian_apologist%29),
who will talk of each word\'s specifics, and [Chuck
Missler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Missler) who noted that the
first occurrence of the word,
[love](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=Love&wholeWords=false)
is in [Genesis
22:2](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2022:2).
The exact table, is a holding area, for staging information; it could be
argued that there is no need, to have this table, because it sources its
information from the Scripture table, and it is available using
[Language Integrated
Query](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query). The
reasoning of the author is that the Scripture table is static data, and
it does not need processing, each time, there is a request. Speed and
lower work load are the advantages of the approach of the author; its
disadvantage is that the exact table needs re-population, when there is
a shift to another Bible version, which the author does not project, at
this time. If there is a need, to support another Bible version, then
the Exact table loading procedure needs expansion to aid, this
flexibility. The
[Exact](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/Exact.html?bibleWord=KAA)
result for the author\'s initials, KAA, is Karkaa, meaning
[floor](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/bibledictionary.html?bibleWord=Karkaa)
([Joshua
15:3](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Joshua%2015:3)).
[Word
Occurrences](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordGroup/WordOccurrences.html?bibleWord=Christ)
is dynamic, and it supports the other versions of the Bible.

##### The Exact Table\'s ExactID Column {#ExactTableExactIDColumn}

The ExactID is an [identity
column](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_column), meaning the
database, SQL Server, auto-increments its value, before insertion. There
are 12891 unique words, in the Bible..Exact table. The SQL statement
`SELECT MAX(ExactID) FROM Bible..Exact` is for determining the highest
value. The SQL statement `SELECT COUNT(BibleWord) FROM Bible..Exact` is
for determining the word count. The SQL statement
`ALTER TABLE Bible..Exact ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Exact_ExactID_Range CHECK (ExactID BETWEEN 1 AND 12891)`
is for the range restriction. For storage reason, the author has chosen,
not to have a unique index, on this candidate primary key; in-spite, of
it being a query item. Future implementation, may issue the SQL
statement
`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX AK_Exact_ExactID ON Bible..Exact(ExactID)`
`SELECT SUM(FrequencyOfOccurrence) FROM Bible..Exact`{datetime="2020-12-14T16:51:00"}
is 789631; this is the count of the words in the KJV Bible.

##### The Exact Table\'s BibleWord Column {#ExactTableBibleWordColumn}

These are the words that occur in the Bible, in the order of their
occurrences. The author sets the [primary
key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_key), the constraint, by
issuing the SQL statement
`ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Exact] ADD CONSTRAINT [PK_Exact] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([BibleWord] ASC)`.

##### The Exact Table\'s FirstOccurrenceScriptureReference Column {#ExactTableFirstOccurrenceScriptureReferenceColumn}

This is the scripture reference where the word first occurs in the
Bible. The author may set-up the relationship by issuing the SQL
statement
`ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Exact] WITH CHECK ADD CONSTRAINT [FK_Exact_Scripture] FOREIGN KEY(FirstOccurrenceScriptureReference) REFERENCES dbo.Scripture (ScriptureReference)`.
Please note, that as discussed earlier, the author cannot have, a unique
constraint, on the Bible..Scripture.ScriptureReference column, since
this is a computed column; the author can not keep up the relationship,
at this time.

##### The Exact Table\'s LastOccurrenceScriptureReference Column {#ExactTableLastOccurrenceScriptureReferenceColumn}

This is the reference to the scripture where the word last occurs in the
Bible; if there is only one occurrence, the value of this entry is null.
As with the FirstOccurrence column, the referential integrity rule
applies.

##### The Exact Table\'s Difference Column {#ExactTableDifferenceColumn}

This is to measure the word\'s longevity; the difference in
VerseIDSequence between when it first and last appeared.

##### The Exact Table\'s Occurrence Column {#Occurrence}

This is the pervasiveness of the word, how often is the word used in the
Bible?

### The WordEngineering Database {#WordEngineeringDatabase}

The WordEngineering SQL Server database, mainly consists, of four
tables - [HisWord](#HisWord), [Remember](#Remember), [APass](#APass),
[ActToGod](#ActToGod).

#### The HisWord Table {#HisWord}

The HisWord table is what the author heard from the source. The entries
in the HisWord table are exact and representable in alphanumeric format
([Numbers
12:6-8](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Numbers%2012:6-8)).
In following, the Bible\'s New Testament convention, where there are
translations of Hebrew words to English [which is being
interpreted](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=which%20is%20being%20interpreted),
([Matthew 1:23, Mark 5:41, Mark 15:22, Mark 15:34, John 1:38, John 1:41,
Acts
4:36](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%201:23,%20Mark%205:41,%20Mark%2015:22,%20Mark%2015:34,%20John%201:38,%20John%201:41,%20Acts%20:36,%201%20Corinthians%2014:28));
so also, there are translations of Yoruba words to English.

There have been cases when the author cannot spell and fully comprehend
what he heard. In such cases, and not dispose of the records, the author
will partly enter what he heard. This impedance mismatch between what
the speaker said and what the listener heard, rarely occurs with English
words. But it is likely, in the author\'s native language, Yoruba, which
exploits word combinations and phrases. The alphabets differ slightly
between the English and Yoruba languages; Yoruba contains diacritic
alphabets. The author requires a Yoruba dictionary and translator; a
recent success is with the <http://translate.google.com> web page.

The HisWord table\'s most important column, as the name suggests, is the
word column, which is either English or Yoruba; or a mixture of both
languages. The author will yield to the Holy Spirit in translating
Yoruba words to English. From previous experience, this translation is
not always the most right or relevant, and different words may contain
the diacritic alphabets; therefore, introduce various meanings ([1
Corinthians 12:30, 1 Corinthians
14](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=1%20Corinthians%2012:30,%201%20Corinthians%2014)).
To account for the discrepancy in translation, the author sought help
from the LORD:

1.  2015-11-02T22:55:00 [And, the merge, is the money,
    convert.](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=And,%20the%20merge,%20is%20the%20money,%20convert.){datetime="2015-11-02T22:55:00"
    hiswordid="78834" contactid="9229"}
2.  2015-11-03T02:17:00 [The specifics, a
    language.](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=The%20specifics,%20a%20language.){datetime="2015-11-03T02:17:00"
    hiswordid="78829" contactid="9230"}

The word column is a potential natural primary key, since duplicates are
rare. When redundancies do occur, we may append the sequence to the
word, to generate a unique word. We do this manually, but an [insert
trigger](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/plsql/plsql_triggers.htm), will
offer automation, and will cut the risk of primary key violation, which
leads to gaps in the identity column [and, loss of
data.](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=and,%20loss%20of%20data.){datetime="2025-03-18T18:08:00"

commentary="2025-03-18T18:08:00 urine."}

The HisWord\'s table, commentary column, contains implicit information.
This communication is most likely non-verbal, and it is information such
as creatures standing or moving towards particular locations or engaging
in other visible activities.

As such, from the creation account, on the first day, there is a
commandment, and there may be an action/response. The commandment is in
the word column God created light ( [Genesis 1:3,
5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%201:3,%205)
). The action is in the commentary column; God separated the light from
the darkness ([Genesis 1:1-2,
4](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%201:1-2,%204)).

Microsoft SQL Server generates sequential numbers for the HisWordID
[identity column](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_column). The
goodness of this technique is that it is a candidate primary key, data
loss is trackable, and it provides a sort key. The HisWordID column may
serve as the [primary](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_primarykey.asp)
and/or [foreign key](http://www.1keydata.com/sql/sql-foreign-key.html),
the backbone of the [Referential Integrity
Constraint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity).

The Dated column is of the DateTime type. If an insert statement does
not explicitly specify a value for the dated column, then it defaults to
the current date and time of the [(UTC-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)

preference for the [Coordinated Universal Time

#### HisWord_view {#Hisword_view}

The HisWord_view composes of the computed columns deducted from
analyzing the Word. The two most significant computations are the
AlphabetSequenceIndex, and the reliant
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference, respectively. The author
derives the AlphabetSequenceIndex from the word by adding the place of
the alphabets in the alphabet set. In the ASCII table, the lower case
alphabets are between 97 and 122, and the upper case alphabets are
between 65 and 90. The lower and upper case alphabets have the same
places. The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference is the books,
chapters, verses separation in the scripture. The author will consider
the chapter and verse place, forward and backward. Use the
[AlphabetSequence.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequence.html)
to calculate the computed values identified above. The AlphabetSequence
is like [Gematria, Mispar Hechrachi
method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria). [Titles of
God](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordGroup/AndThePriestSaidAreOneOnlyForMe.html).

#### The Remember Table {#Remember}

The Remember table tries to correlate the period between a prophecy and
its fulfillment. "[The [terminus a
quo](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/terminus_a_quo) DatedFrom is when the
prophecy begins, and it marks the the date of issue or establishing of
the prophecy. The [terminus ad
quem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_post_quem) DatedUntil is
when a prophecy partially or entirely comes to
pass.]{cite="#bibliographyKoinoniaHouse"}" (Koinonia House).
[DateDifference.aspx](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/DateDifference.aspx)
is for calculating the difference between terminus a quo, versus
terminus ad quem; the results are in days; biblical years, months, days;
the Common Era. The inspiration for adding the Common Era comes from
[wikipedia.org](http://www.wikipedia.org) by Jimmy Wales.

To determine the HisWord and Remember entries? The author chooses to
separate the particular and prompted inputs ( [Luke
4:19](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%204:19)
).

#### APass {#APass datetime="2020-12-14T17:02:00"}

#### ActToGod {#ActToGod datetime="2020-12-14T17:03:00"}

This is subjective work; the author applys intelligence to find patterns
and resemblances in the Bible.

### Index Query Type {#IndexQueryType datetime="2024-11-15T15:53:00"}

Query Type
:::

Commentary

Example

Structured Query Language (SQL)

Point query

It will return only 1 record, and it is restricted by an equality
condition on the primary key or unique index.

Useful for searching for a particular verse.

``` {2024-11-18t15:51:00=""}
    SELECT *
    FROM Bible..Scripture_View
    WHERE VerseIDSequence = 1
    
```

Multipoint query

It may return more than 1 record, as there may be multiple records. It
is restricted by an equality condition on part of a potential composite
key.

Useful for searching for a particular chapter or book.

``` {2024-11-18t15:51:00=""}
    SELECT *
    FROM Bible..Scripture_View
    WHERE ChapterIDSequence = 1
    
```

Range query

It returns a set of records whose values are within an interval or half
interval. If it is restricted by both lower and upper bounds, then there
is an interval. It is a half interval, if it specifies only one bound.

Useful for searching for consecutive verses, chapters or books.

``` {2024-11-19t23:47:00=""}
    SELECT *
    FROM Bible..Scripture_View
    WHERE VerseIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 10
    ;
    SELECT *
    FROM Bible..Scripture_View
    WHERE VerseIDSequence <= 5
    
```

Prefix match query

The set is the match of an attribute.

The author is unfamiliar with any use-case where only the first part of
the wildcard is searched. The first part of the scripture reference is
similar. For the BibleWord searches, the author uses like for match
queries.

``` {2024-11-21t03:52:00=""}
SELECT *
FROM Bible..Scripture_View
WHERE KingJamesVersion LIKE
(
    SELECT TOP 1 KingJamesVersion
    FROM Bible..Scripture_View
    GROUP BY KingJamesVersion
    ORDER BY COUNT(KingJamesVersion) DESC
)
    
```

Extremal query

It returns either the minimum or maximum extreme.

Statistics

``` {2024-11-21t17:46:00=""}
SELECT *
FROM Bible..Scripture_View
WHERE VerseIDSequence =
(
    SELECT MAX( VerseIDSequence )
    FROM Bible..Scripture_View
)
    
```

Ordering query

The records returned are sorted.

The results of the author are normally in ascending order.

``` {2024-11-21t18:02:00=""}
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM Bible..Scripture_View
ORDER BY VerseIDSequence DESC
    
```

Grouping query

The records returned are grouped.

Rarely does the author group rows by issuing the group by clause.

``` {2024-11-21t18:09:00=""}
SELECT BookGroup, COUNT(BookGroup ) BookGroupVersesCount
FROM Bible..Scripture_View
GROUP BY BookGroup
ORDER BY BookGroup
    
```

Equi-join query

The records are retrieved from multiple sources.

The author uses views for table joins.

### Designing Software Architectures: A Practical Approach Making Design Decisions {#DesigningSoftwareArchitecturesAPracticalApproach_MakingDesignDecisions datetime="2024-08-21T14:34:00"}

1.  Use Facts
2.  Check Assumptions\
    -   This whole thing started with keeping [a work
        reference.](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=a%20work%20reference.){datetime="2024-08-21T16:41:00"

    -   Even though Yoruba is the native language of the author, he
        still and invariably relies on translate.google.com.
    -   The author depends on a typing assistant.
3.  Explore Contexts\
    Information re-use was the driving force of this software
    engineering. The author sought to learn programming and retain
    knowledge.
4.  Anticipate Risks\
    The undesirable outcome and their probability of re-occurrence will
    include:
    -   Data loss or corruption because of issuing the database
        modification command and lack of timely archiving
    -   Hardware, software, or network failure
    -   [Vendor withdrawal of
        support](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=Vendor%20withdrawal%20of%20support){datetime="2024-08-21T18:38:00"
        hiswordid="163587"}\
        Microsoft:\
        -   Introduced .NET core and Model-view-controller (MVC).
        -   Inability to restore deprecated Microsoft SQL Server backup
            versions.
        -   Command-line reverse-engineering of database script does not
            conform with the newly released data types.
5.  Assign Priorities\
    The author prefers to first build and implement his strengths and
    specialties in the back-end (database and process logic), prior to
    designing the creative user interface.
6.  Define Time Horizon\
    [What period has God
    used?](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=What%20period%20has%20God%20used%3F){datetime="2024-08-22T11:14:00"

    -   1997, priesthood age: I have brought something against you, but
        I Am with you.
    -   2007, generation timespan: This masturbation will bring water.
7.  Generate Multiple Solution Options\
    [How versatile am I\... at amending
    others?](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=How%20versatile%20am%20I...%20at%20amending%20others%3F){datetime="2024-08-23T08:41:00"

8.  Design Around Constraints\
    [Relational databases offer the ability to set

    hiswordid="163618"}
    -   Data type
    -   Nullable
    -   Primary key and unique index
    -   Foreign key
9.  Weigh the Pros and Cons\
    -   Data import\...data input: Initially, the author created an XML
        file and imported it into database tables via a C# program
        application. When this process malfunctioned, the author
        suspended his work. The author resumed work by doing data input
        via Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio grids. This diversion
        did not require database changes, achieving separation of
        concerns.

-   Microsoft SQL Server offers the capability to cut off the size of
    the result set. The GetAPage.html gets minute data from the various
    database tables and views. The user may be given the opportunity to
    customize which results to retrieve, for example, AlphabetSequence,
    BibleWord, HisWord, or Dictionary. [A literate person may not need
    as much data.]{datetime="2024-02-06T15:34:00"} [Setting this

-   An approach is to offload computing to the local host.

(Hitachi 2023). "[]{cite="#bibliographyCraigMullins20231218"}"

### Database Performance {#DatabasePerformance datetime="2024-01-29T22:35:00"}

-   Query optimization: Server-side database processing offers the best
    performance scenario. The use of stored procedures and functions is
    recommended. [The hold backs are their deployments and SQL
    variances.]{datetime="2024-01-29T23:26:00"} Prepared statements are
    fast, resource lenient, cached, and they prevent SQL injection
    attacks. The author falls back on dynamic SQL for complex queries.
-   Indexing: The author is well aware of the pros of indexing, but its
    cons include additional space and effort. [The less performant
    productive database objects are keys and
    constraints.]{datetime="2024-01-30T08:23:00"}
-   Data Modeling: Normalization
    1.  First Normal Form (1NF): A relation meets this rule when each
        attribute has only one value. Another condition is that all the
        attribute values are atomic and non-composite. In the HisWord
        table there may be multiple contacts, but only the most
        prominent contact is recorded. A contact must be first created
        in the Contact table, prior to its referencing, to satisfy its
        referential integrity constraint. The author does abide with 1NF
        in the HisWord table. The URI column may contain multiple e-mail
        addresses. The scripture reference column may not be a unit.
    2.  Second Normal Form (2NF): The ActToGod table does not comply
        with this rule, since its Minor column is functionally dependent
        on its Major column. [Computed columns minimize the potential
        for this.]{datetime="2024-01-30T20:25:00"}

### Database Scaling {#DatabaseScaling datetime="2023-02-13T18:31:00"}

-   The transition to computed columns results in smaller storage
    requirements.
-   Microsoft SQL Server supports multiple databases; therefore,
    reducing archive needs.
-   Normalization, object-to-relational mapping, is light load.

#### Select Clause {#SelectClause datetime="2023-02-10T15:53:00"}

The select clause may explictly include a column list. Pre-compiled
statements that implictly cater for all the source columns, may not be
up-to-date on the column-list.

#### Group By Clause {#GroupByClause datetime="2023-02-10T16:13:00"}

The group by statement is not for detail listing, except when it is used
to regress to the distinct clause. Group by supports statistics, such
as, count, sum, min, max, avg.

#### Having By Clause {#HavingByClause datetime="2023-02-10T16:19:00"}

The having clause augments the group by clause. It places restriction on
the group(s) returned.

#### Insert Statement {#InsertStatement datetime="2023-02-10T16:23:00"}

Inserts give room to omit the default columns. The Identity Insert
statement also grants explicit entry of its identity column.

#### Nullable Column {#NullableColumn datetime="2023-02-10T16:30:00"}

Information unknown is useful for forwarding processing, until and if
the information is added. Outer Join stands for this purpose.

#### View {#View datetime="2023-02-10T16:38:00"}

Enhances tables by compacting and/or extending the information set.

#### Constraint {#Constraint datetime="2023-02-10T20:23:00"}

Primary and foreign keys, unique indexes and check constraints.

### Data Cleansing {#DataCleansing datetime="2022-08-19T11:00:00"}

        until.
    -   Non-surrogate primary and foreign keys with unique indexes help
        to ascertain data.
    -   Default columns are probable system generated that the users may
        leave unfilled that are available from sequence, identity,
        system clock.
-   Is the data incomplete, such as abbreviation, for example CA or
    California, telephone numbers without country or area code?

-   Duplicate entries are isolatable by using the group by clause.

### The author prescribes the steps below to begin database set-up and usage {#the-author-prescribes-the-steps-below-to-begin-database-set-up-and-usage datetime="2022-06-07T14:17:00"}

1.  Acquire a database management system (DBMS). Various varieties of
    DBMS are available. The user may download a DBMS, get a compact
    disc, or select from the cloud.
2.  Install a DBMS.
3.  Decide on a user interface for managing the database. For Microsoft
    SQL Server, the choices include the SQLCmd console utility or the
    SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio.
4.  Create database. Microsoft SQL Server supports multiple instances
    and databases.
5.  The data definition language (DDL) includes the commands to create,
    alter, or delete tables, views, primary and foreign keys, indexes,
    constraints and defaults.
6.  The data manipulation language (DML) are commands to insert, update,
    and delete the database rows and columns, with the option to use the
    where clause.
7.  The SQL Server maintenance plan is for database housekeeping, for
    example, backup, restore, and re-arrangement.
8.  Stored-procedures, triggers, and functions are programmable logic.

### Indexing {#indexing datetime="2021-12-25T00:06:00"}

The author manually indexes according to the following progression:

-   The URI database is separable into the following tables:
    -   URIChrist
    -   URIEntertainment
    -   URIGoogleNews
    -   URIWordEngineering
-   The SacredText table is for scripture reference.
-   The Exact table is an index of the words in the King James Version
    (KJV) of the Bible.
-   The source of information is in the bibliography section.

### Programming {#programming datetime="2021-12-02T11:46:00"}

The Author Programs in the Following Tiers and Languages

Tier

Language

Commentary

Front-End Browser

HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Javascript, Cascading Style Sheet
(CSS)

The front-end code may run on a desktop, laptop, or mobile telephone
that offers a user interface (UI). The task is to accept the user query
and to display the result. Initially, as a novice programmer, the author
wrote specific code for each user request; later, the author rests on
generic code which will handle multiple variety of requests. This is
high-level programming, and the skill-set entry level is minimal. The
author also believes that the users should not require any formal
training to use his work. Customization is achievable by varying the
request options, such as entry form selections, query arguments, or data
attributes.

Middle-Tier Application

C#, Embedded-SQL

For backward compatibility, the author does not envision moving away
from his legacy code investment in Microsoft. The only shift is
positioning code away from database inconsistencies in back-end
residency. To code, compile, debug, deploy, the experience of the author
is with Microsoft Visual Studio and command-line tools.

Server-Side Backend

Standard Query Language (SQL)

The author most recent experience is with the Sybase and Microsoft
Transact-SQL assortment. Now a days, to be compatible and after
experimentation; the author rarely uses Standard Query Language - Common
Language Runtime (SQL-CLR). The author does database data entry,
maintenance, development by using the Microsoft SQL Server Management
Studio.

### JavaScript Basics: Data Types {#javascript-basics-data-types datetime="2021-12-05T03:44:00"}

-   JavaScript supports three keywords for declaring variables. These
    are the var, let, const keywords.
-   From its pre-conception, JavaScript supported the var keyword. When
    the author does not precede a variable initialization with a
    keyword, then the variable will have global scope. The author averts
    from variable hoisting. Variable definition with the var keyword is
    re-usable. The strict mode is a later addition to JavaScript that
    helps in enforcing variable rules.
-   For one-time definitions, such as, issuing the
    document.getElementById command, the author relies on the const
    keyword.
-   Unlike some typed languages, JavaScript does not support explicitly
    specifying the type of a variable.
-   JavaScript string comparisons are by default case-sensitive.

### Functions and Methods {#functions-and-methods datetime="2021-12-05T17:51:00"}

-   Methods are functions that are referrable from a class. Methods
    support object orientation by offering encapsulation, inheritance,
    polymorphism. The author uses functions when placing localizable
    code inside the script section of a HTML file; otherwise,
    generalized methods are referenceable from a JavaScript library.
-   JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, and they are
    passable as variables. This abstraction feature is rarely necessary.
-   JavaScript does not support method overloading. The earlier
    arguments array variable and the later parameter default
    initialization supplements.
-   The author consistently uses anonymous functions for processing the
    success and error returns when using jQuery to access web services.

### Conditions {#conditions datetime="2021-12-06T15:21:00"}

-   The author emulates the Microsoft ASP.NET Page.IsPostBack property
    check, and when it is not so, parse the query arguments; otherwise,
    skip the parsing and proceed to page submittion.

### Arrays and Loops {#arrays-and-loops datetime="2021-12-07T03:13:00"}

-   For displaying the Bible book titles, the 66 books are in a
    JavaScript iterable array. This reduces the data load from the
    server to client, and it offers spelling flexibility. The select
    options resemble similar customization.

### HyperText Markup Language (HTML) Document {#hypertext-markup-language-html-document datetime="2021-12-07T11:37:00"}

-   The DOCTYPE is the first declaration in an HTML document, and it is
    the conformation standard specification.
-   The html tag is the root and the container for all the other tags.
-   The head tag contains the title and the meta tags for the search
    engine optimization (SEO). The various documents will indicate the
    cascading style sheet (CSS) directive.
-   The body tag contains the visible content of the document. Its
    resultSet or resultTable div will contain the particular details
    that the program generates.

### Data Science {#data-science datetime="2021-12-08T01:10:00"}

#### What is data?

The data that the author fundamentally operates on is the word from God.
The initial and primary data is textual, but now the author places
importance on dates and numbers.

What should you do with a number? Even though the Hebrew language is
AlphaNumeric, the numbers in the Bible are in words ( [Leviticus
19:26](/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Leviticus%2019:26){target="_blank"}
). When the author receives a number, he records it in the HisWord\'s
table, Word column, as a numeral.

1.  The author extracts knowledge from data; by finding meaning to the
    word.
2.  The author uses scientific methods, such as counting the number of
    occurrences, determining the first and last occurrences, and
    excluding the parts of speech.
3.  The actionable insights take, so far, is to computerize the work.
4.  The vast majority of the work is structured data. Unstructured data
    does not fit into the background of the author.
5.  The application domain is Bible studies; how relevant is the Bible
    to our work?

#### Practicing Data Science {#practicing-data-science datetime="2021-12-08T08:40:00"}

1.  Empirical, find implication from the Bible?
2.  Theoretical, to determine a better way to doing work?
3.  Computational, is human labor replaceable?
4.  Data-Driven, constraints help us to sanitize data. Default values
    reduces task, are less error prone, brings arrangement.

#### Where to get Data {#where-to-get-data datetime="2021-12-08T09:38:00"}

1.  The Bible is our primary source of data.
2.  The author records information sources. This is either a person or
    media?

#### What you can do with Data {#what-you-can-do-with-data datetime="2021-12-08T09:55:00"}

1.  Data Acquisition: The Bible is available on the Microsoft Access
    database.
2.  Data Storage: The author imports this tabular data into the
    Microsoft SQL Server relational database.
3.  Data Processing: The SQL Select statement is the means of retrieving
    data from the database. This is not always a monolithic fashion;
    since there are various ways of composing the queries.
4.  Visualization / Human Insights:
    -   The raw data is viewable on the Microsoft SQL Server Management
        Studio.
    -   The web service, .asmx, file, which is accessible from the
        browser, offers the opportunity to fill-in the query and see the
        JSON result.
    -   The .html presents the result in a human readable format.

#### Defining Data {#defining-data datetime="2021-12-08T10:43:00"}

1.  Quantitative Data: This makes itself subjective to numeric
    computation. AlphabetSequence is an attempt to give value to words.
2.  Qualitative Data: These are rarely measurable and are personal
    interpretation.

#### A brief introduction to Statistics and Probability {#a-brief-introduction-to-statistics-and-probability datetime="2021-12-08T11:11:00"}

At the beginning of the study, the author made a presumption that words
are unique. Later the author found out that there are duplicate Bible
verses.

(Microsoft) "[]{cite="#bibliographyVaibhavVerdhan"}"

### Data {#data datetime="2020-10-22T20:00:00"}

#### Structured and Unstructured

Structured data is alphanumeric put in row-column. Unstructured data is
either text, image, audio, or video. This research is mainly structured
data.

#### Standard

The author imports complete, not NULL nor empty data, such as the Bible
and the dictionaries.

The author achieves data validity by constraining and restricting
inputs. Since this is not a commercial work, Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) are not vital.

The author references and is not tampering with authoritative Bible
work; this helps to make sure correctness - accuracy, consistency,
integrity.

Timeliness is effectual in the single user data entry table, HisWord.

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)

#### Class

The information which the author documents in this section of the paper;
is the Data Declaration Language (DDL) and Data Dictionary, which is
available at [GitHub.com SQLServerDataDefinitionLanguageDDL
Repository](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/SQLServerDataDefinitionLanguageDDL)
The Data Manipulation Language (DML) is too large to fit into the
GitHub.com repository, and it is intellectual property. For the people
that have access to the database, this private information is available
by generating the database script.

Contact is a primary entity, and it identifies the people and
organizations that the author has a relationship with. These
affiliations are family, friends, business, or public service links.
Also recordable are their street, e-mail, web addresses, and telephone
numbers. The author stores the various information exchanges with these
people. A known date of birth, is for notification of the subject\'s
birthday and relative age. To keep up with the privacy and sensitivity
of this personal information, the author is not sharing this highly
confidential data.

The relationship between a contact and its related information is
one-to-many; that is a contact may have multiple addresses. The other 2
types of relationships are one-to-one, and many-to-many.

A URI is a link to a web resource that will add to the audience\'s
knowledge. The author notes the address and the date, when the author
became aware of this information. The content at an address is either
textual, audio, video, or image? [ For URIs, the author rarely
explicitly specifies the entire http protocol and directory post-fix, /.
An incomplete address will not validate as an input url type.
]{datetime="2021-10-01T03:43:00"} The author only records the
[Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) address\' at the place of
reference since it is easy to associate the title with the Wikipedia
address.

Exists or does not exists? The transact-sql exists clause is useful for
checking the existence of an object and if so, drop the object. This is
applicable prior to re-creating the object. Please note that the
metadata information is lost and the create or alter statement
supercedes this approach. The exists clause is also useful in queries
for determining the existence of a resultset.

These classes are important asset for the anniversary triggers; in the
Remember entries.

### Database and Application Server Source Files

The author chose a multi-tier architecture for building the application.
The database layer is made-up of tables, views, stored procedures,
functions. The database tables are easily storable and movable to other
storage media. The SQL Server\'s data definition language (DDL), now
supports DateTime2, and its date range extend between January 1, 1 CE
through December 31, 9999 CE. Some dates in
[Wikipedia](http://www.Wikipedia.com) mention these dates. The
HisWord_view contains computed columns, which depend on entries in the
HisWord table. The author extracts database information by building
query statements.\
The application layer is the bridge between the user interface layer and
the database layer. The application layer compiles into a single
[Dynamic-link
library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library) (DLL),
called InformationInTransit.dll. The application layer consists of four
namespaces, namely, InformationInTransit.DataAccess,
InformationInTransit.ProcessCode, InformationInTransit.ProcessLogic,
InformationInTransit.UserInterface. What the author builds on the
server; is accessible to all the clients. What is the lifetime of this
code, and what neutrality does it condone? The author started out with
[dBASE II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase). The lines of code for
the application layer are in the C# and embedded SQL.

### Client Browser Source Files

-   [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) (.html)
-   [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) (.js)
-   [Cascading Style
    Sheets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (.css)

The .HTML files will work in all browsers; that support AJAX. Most of
the interactive web pages are reliant on JavaScript to work, mainly
because they use Ajax to interact with the server. Each .HTML file,
performs specific task, and may have a corresponding back-end associate,
web service. The unobtrusive JavaScript file
[9432.js](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/IIS/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.js)
contains re-usable code that is not .HTML files specific. The .HTML
files originally contained the .CSS specifications; however, the author
now places styling information in a single external file,
[9432.css](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/IIS/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.css).
This will reduce the sizes of the .HTML files, and it helps to achieve a
consistent user interface.

The work of the author is interactive, and there are links to questions
and answers pages. Most of the input entries are textual, but some are
numeric, datetime, select options. The answers are mostly in tabular
format.

(Vaibhav Verdhan). "[A HTML document
contains:]{cite="#bibliographyElizabethCastro2012"}"

-   Text content: The author informs the reader by describing His word.
-   References to other files: The author refers to external files, such
    as UML images.
-   Markup:
    -   Elements: The anchor tag is the most specific.
    -   Attributes and Values: The author benefits from the introduction
        of the customizable data- prefix attribute.

(Elizabeth Castro). "[]{cite="#bibliographyJonathanSnook"}"

#### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) {#CascadingStyleSheetsCSS datetime="2021-05-06T21:00:00"}

-   Base Rules: A base rule is an element and not a class nor ID
    selector. The author does not use CSS Resets. The author issues
    element selectors for the html, body, table and row.
-   Layout Rules: There are no layout rules, such as header nor footer.
-   Module Rules: The table of content (TOC) is for page navigation that
    the author offers using class names.
-   State Rules: A state rule is for toggling, such as using Javascript
    to set the visibility.

(Jonathan Snook).

### Web Services

"[There is standardization on the first .NET web services architecture,
.ASMX.]{cite="#bibliographyFrederikBulthoff2019"}" (FrederikBulthoff,
2019) In most cases, there is a one-to-one mapping between the .HTML,
.ASMX, .CS files, and the database relational table, Bible..Scripture.
For simplicity and clearage of use, the .HTML and .ASMX files, support
one operation. GetAPage.html is the workhorse for word utterances.
GetAPage.html will send AJAX requests to multiple .ASMX files and
operations. GetAPage.html is a cumulation of separate .HTML files. All
the web services files support the SOAP request format and return JSON.
jQuery accepts the POST, HTTP verb. The author stringified the data he
passes to the web service in the body of the message. Errors are
unforeseen, in the rare case, the author logs errors on the back-end,
and display quantitative message. Security is lacking; this is
permissible; since the author only queries information.

The web service code, .asmx, file is not necessary, does not have a
place, when there is no server database access ( [Numbers 19:2, 2
Chronicles 15:3, John 15:25, Romans 2:12, Romans 3:21, Romans 3:28,
Romans 7:8, Romans 7:9, 1 Corinthians 9:21, Hebrews
9:22](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Numbers%2019:2,%202%20Chronicles%2015:3,%20John%2015:25,%20Romans%202:12,%20Romans%203:21,%20Romans%203:28,%20Romans%207:8,%20Romans%207:9,%201%20Corinthians%209:21,%20Hebrews%209:22)
).

The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) is available, for example,
by specifying the URI,
[AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL)
To generate a proxy code, issue the following command;
` wsdl.exe /language:CS /namespace:InformationInTransit.ProcessLogic /out:"AlphabetSequenceWebServiceProxy.cs" http://localhost/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL `
The Web Services Discovery Utility (disco) command:
` disco.exe "http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.disco" `
will generate the companion files; AlphabetSequenceWebService.disco,
AlphabetSequenceWebService.wsdl, and results.discomap

A lecture of our beginning. (Hafida Na ̈ım, 2016) The business rule is
storable and processable in C#, (.cs), source files. The dynamic link
library, (.dll), is callable from everywhere. GetAPage.html computes
AlphabetSequence from a simple logic, which is easily representable
everywhere. The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference is retrievable
from the Bible, using non-complex SQL query. The BibleWord and HisWord
reference, requires substantive query. The Bible dictionary returns
dataset from the local database. The author can not make a business
decision, to go to a web service, to retrieve what is locally
resideable.

### Database Size

The usp_DatabaseLogSize stored procedure is for determining the size of
the databases data files; and it is available at [T-SQL to find
Data,Log,Size and Other Useful information -SQL
2000/2005/2008/R2](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/T-SQL-to-find-DataLogSize-3564cfc0).

"[]{cite="#bibliographyABB_AseaBrownBoveri"}"

### Database Standard

#### Database Design

1.  The relational model is for storing information in tables.
2.  The author normalizes data using Object-relational mapping.
3.  All the databases are OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), not
    OLAP (Online analytical processing).
4.  Avoid deadlock occurrences by not permitting user database updates.
5.  All the transactions follow similar routes and sequences, and the
    author practices granularity with the locks.
6.  Database updates are through stored procedures, which recognize and
    avoid the potential of integrity violation.

#### Database Security

1.  The secretive web.config file contains the database access
    information.
2.  The web.config file does not explicitly mention the user login name
    nor password.
3.  Give access rights to roles, not to specific login identities nor
    user names.

#### Database Data Types

1.  Choose matching data types between the database and application
    layers.
2.  Only pick varchar(max) and nvarchar(max) as the data type, when it
    is essential to store large data.
3.  Prefer the decimal type; when recording the amount in currency
    rather than using the float type.

#### Nullable Type

1.  Consider defaulting textual data to empty string; instead of NULL.

#### Indexes

1.  Database changes lags with indexes.
2.  The field sequence in indexes should follow the frequency of usage.
3.  When using a composite index, place a clustered non-unique index on
    the major column.

#### Naming Conventions

1.  Overall, consistency encourages lowercase keywords. Keywords in
    lowercase are mandatory in case-sensitive programming languages like
    C# and JavaScript, but not in SQL.
2.  Use Pascal casing for naming literals, such as, tables, columns,
    stored procedures and functions.
3.  Use Camel casing for naming parameters and local variables.

### Performance {#performance datetime="2021-11-28T18:00:00"}

The web page components practice of the author, include:

1.  Keep the count of web page components to a minimum
2.  Specialize input entries by using the most simple and basic
    component
3.  Reduce bloating by limiting the use of framework and library

1.  The most consistent id=\"resultSet\" is usually for AJAX. The
    self-descriptive tags that do not influence the result normally do
    not specify IDs, this is left to the browser\'s decision.
2.  Browsers place restrictions on the number of concurrent connections
    to a particular domain and the overall parallel connections.
    Consider spreading out the resources to multiple domains.
3.  The author standardized on the .png image format because there are
    few colors.
4.  In the year 2008, when the author tried to move away from html table
    layout styling, the rendering was anaemic.

The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) performance suggestions include:

1.  Since, by default, CSS is a render-blocking resource, the author
    should take advantage of the critical rendering path with media
    types and media queries.
2.  All the programming .html files refer to the common 9432.css file,
    except this ubiquitous 2015-10-23DoctoralDissertation.html
    documentation file which includes css.

The JavaScript performance suggestions include:

1.  Make use of browser cacheable content delivery networks (CDNs). For
    example, <http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js>

(Lara Callender Hogan) "[]{cite="#bibliographyIlyaGrigorik2013"}"

### High Performance Browser Networking {#high-performance-browser-networking datetime="2022-10-24T02:05:00"}

For Internet connections, the contributing factors include:

1.  Propagation delay - The consideration is the speed of light in the
    medium of transport. On the Internet the speed varies according to
    the medium which may be (DSL, cable, fiber) in order of performance.
    The speed of light, which was presumably constant, but now, may be
    declining. The author chooses the most accessible route. Typically,
    working within the confines of a building. This research excludes
    other participants. The environment is transplantable for other
    uses. The route and environment impose limitations on the local
    host. The traceroute command on the Linux operating system, or the
    similar tracert or pathping commands on the Windows operating
    system, will give travel speed. The author will look into the
    last-mile tendencies of the Internet Service Providers (ISP) in the
    area. [ The receive window (rwnd) of the server should be adequate,
    since the users do not upload videos nor images.
    ]{datetime="2022-10-30T07:29:00"}
2.  Transmission delay - The time to input the packet into the link,
    which is determined by the length of the packet and the data rate of
    the link. On the author\'s behalf, the Bible book ID is transmitted
    to the client and convertible to the title by JavaScript. Formatting
    is done by the client.
3.  Processing delay - The duration of processing the header, detect
    bit-level errors, and determine the other end. In an Intranet
    environment, this is done locally.
4.  Queuing delay - The processing wait time is dependent on the browser
    supporting multiple page tabs, and other applicatons using the
    network?

Most of the work of the author is available at the following locations,
in the order of efficiency:

1.  The current web page, such as, 2015-10-23DoctoralDissertation.html
    file
2.  The general Cascading Style Sheet, 9432.css file
3.  The general JavaScript file, 9432.js file
4.  The specific Web Service file, such as,
    ScriptureReferenceWebService.asmx file
5.  The dynamic link library file, InformationInTransit.dll file
6.  The database

The reason for noting this observation is that the Domain Name System
(DNS) lookup time is low; since the author uses relative directory
addressing as much as possible and only uses root addressing for calling
web services. The .html and .asmx files are in numerous directories,
because GitHub.com directories have content count limitations.

Images:

1.  The author does not use background-image nor list-style-image
2.  The thesis only contains images for database and object modeling
3.  The author does not use [CSS
    sprite](http://csssprites.com){target="_blank"}; since it requires
    additional storage space
4.  The author does not use Data URIs
5.  The author does not support nor take advantage of Expires Headers
6.  This research excludes compression and minification; because the
    file sizes are low and technology conformity

(Ilya Grigorik) "[]{cite="#bibliographyIvanAkulov"}"

Web Performance 101 JavaScript:

1.  The author will not consider minification. Because he cannot justify
    compressed file duplicate mix-up. A single compressed file is less
    readable and maintainable. An automated build and deployment process
    may suffice.
2.  DOM chatiness? The author currently builds the entire table, and he
    sets the innerhtml of the div. For faster visibility, the author may
    build a table by first setting its header, and appending rows.
3.  The author should take advantage of the async script parameter.
    Because the actions of the scripts are invoked after the page load.
4.  Code splitting with import serves well for web components and rare
    tasks.

Web Performance 101 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):

1.  Critical CSS is in the style sections of HTML files.

Web Performance 101 content delivery network (CDN):

1.  The author is deprecating the use of the jquery library which was
    solely used for AJAX, in preference to the fetch statement.
2.  The author only uses the latest version and a unique uri for each
    library available on CDN.

### Backup and Off-site Storage

The author archives the database and source files to the local
computers, [Google](http://drive.google.com),
[Microsoft](http://onedrive.live.com) drives, [after
changes.]{datetime="2021-07-24T16:00:00"} The author uses
[GitHub.com](http://github.com/KenAdeniji) version control.

### Development Time

The development time is separable into the time it takes to program,
compile, test, deploy. The stored procedure, C#, ASMX, HTML files are
build-able in one day, in most use-case.

### Reproducible

The deliverable of the author is transferable to other environments to
reach similar conclusions.

### Database Deployment

The author suggests the following alternative methods for deploying the
databases:

1.  [Restore](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/restore-statements-transact-sql)
2.  [Attach](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/attach-a-database)
3.  [Snapshot](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/create-a-database-snapshot-transact-sql)
4.  [SQL Server Data Definition Language
    (DDL)](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/SQLServerDataDefinitionLanguageDDL)

### Surrogate Keys

"[The author takes advantage of potential natural primary keys;
otherwise, the author uses surrogate keys. A surrogate key may be an
identity or GUID type column. URIs are examples of natural primary
keys.]{cite="#bibliographyJosephSack2008"}" (Joseph Sack, 2008)

"[]{cite="#bibliographyThomasHunterII2014"}"

### Application Programming Interface (API) {#ApplicationProgrammingInterface datetime="2022-08-20T20:30:00"}

-   The common url scheme, endpoint, that the author prefers for
    security reasons is
    <https://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering>
-   The Top Level Domain (TLD) is the same for both the website and the
    API, thereby allowing for sharing of cookies.
-   Content Located at the Root: The practice of the author is to place
    the website and their companion API files in the same directories,
    as they are joinable. The author will not uniquely treat API files.
    The author makes a case for directory browsing, and there is a
    special help documentation file.
-   Microsoft released ASP.NET MVC on December 10, 2007.
    <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41906110/designing-rest-api-endpoints-path-params-vs-query-params>
-   Out of the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) 4 operations, the
    API only supports the HTTP read, SQL select statement.
-   Filtering Resources: SQL offers a column list, where, top, limit,
    and order by clauses for matching data.
-   Body Formats: The load penalty in XML overweighs the newness of the
    JSON transport medium.
-   HTTP Status Codes: jQuery satisfactorily handles the success or
    error of an asynchronous operation.
-   Expected Body Content: Each API may currently return either a
    dataset, datatable, or a top level JSON object. The URI database is
    maintainable via a Patch request type to update a particular
    record\'s subset of fields/columns.
-   Versioning: The progress includes:
    -   Migration to computed columns
    -   Normalization
    -   Naming Conventions, SQL for example, is generally case agnostic

(Consumer-Centric API Design) "[]{#DataStructuresAndAlgorithmAnalysis
cite="#bibliographyCliffordAShaffer"}"

### Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis

The exact-match query is to search for a single Bible book, chapter, or
verse. In the case of a verse, the top 1 clause is appropriate to
efficiently return a single record. [ The range query is to search for
information within a boundary. ]{datetime="2022-03-16T07:23:00"}

The Remember table\'s ResultOutputFirst bit column is a rare Boolean
datatype. It is for documentation purposes and it says the FromUntil
period is known and it is used to determine either the FromDated or
UntilDated column.

An identity column is a specialization of the integer data type, in that
the database issues the next sequence. Most of the tables make use of
the identity column as a surrogate primary key.

The aggregate or composite type attempts to store each particular type
in its own table, when this is not optimum then normalization calls for
several tables distribution joined within one view. The contact record
is a single logical datatype spread to multiple physical
implementations.

When the author hears a word, what does he do with it? He dates the
word, he expresses it grammatically, and he finds a place for it in his
memory. [ For a later date, the author reminds himself.
]{datetime="2022-07-25T19:45:00"}

#### Problems, Algorithms, and Programs {#problems-algorithms-and-programs datetime="2022-03-18T13:37:00"}

Problem

When we hear the word, how do we endeavor in Him?

Function, Input, and Output

The input is the word as the only parameter. The output will find
meaning in the word of God. The response of the computer is within the
range of the result set.

Sets and Relations

The alphabets and words make-up the author\'s work. The composition of
the words is indefinite.

-   The ASCII table set composes 26 upper and lower case alphabets.
    Their places will originally decide the AlphabetSequenceIndex.
-   The digits and their larger representations of numbers are also in
    the ASCII table. These are computable in determining the
    AlphabetSequenceIndex.
-   The null character is in the Word column, when there is only
    commentary.
-   Cardinality: Microsoft SQL Server places a limit on the maximum size
    of a VARCHAR column type, 8000. When there are 2 or 3 words, the
    author does further computation.

#### Asymptotic Algorithm Analysis {#asymptotic-algorithm-analysis datetime="2022-03-18T17:17:00"}

The computer serves the author in due time. The size of the users\'
input, the number of users, and the complexity of their requests will
weigh on the system.

This is the approximation measurement of how long it should normally
take to determine the AlphabetSequenceIndex. The prediction is the
length of the word multiplied by the average period taken to determine
the place of each alphabet. The growth rate is that the processing time
increases, as the size of the input grows. There is linear growth, since
the growth rate is constant.

#### Best, Worst, and Average Cases {#best-worst-and-average-cases datetime="2022-03-18T22:05:00"}

There is no variation in time for determining the AlphabetSequenceIndex
and AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference. The size of the word will
influence AlphabetSequenceIndex, but this should not be noticeable. When
parsing and retrieving scripture reference and Bible word, there may be
size and time differences.

#### Calculating the Running Time for a Program {#calculating-the-running-time-for-a-program datetime="2022-03-19T20:52:00"}

The author uses a for loop to calculate the AlphabetSequenceIndex.

    var alphabetSequenceIndex = 0;
    word = word.ToUpper();
    var asciiA = 65;
    for 
    (
        var index = 0, lengthSize = word.length;
        index <= lengthSize;
        ++index
    )
    {
        if (Isalpha(word[index]))
        {
            alphabetSequenceIndex += (int)word[index] - asciiA + 1;
        }
    }   
                    

The cost of executing the for loop is Θ(word.lengthSize)

#### Lists {#lists datetime="2022-03-21T15:48:00"}

One of the few occasions that the author uses a list is when building
the Exact table. The author creates a list of words and stores this
transient information in memory. The author checks the existence of each
word in the list. When it is a new word, the author appends it to the
bottom of the list. Otherwise, the author increments its occurrence. At
the completion of parsing the words, the author stores the list in a
database table. Creating the exact table is a one-time operation, and it
takes a couple of hours to complete.

The author is comfortable and familiar with using datasets and
datatables for work areas. The author uses JSON as a transport medium.

### [GetAPage.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html) Program Flow

The event handlers are the first code the system executes. These are the
page load, submit click, item change events. If this is a page load
event, and it is not a
[postback](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postback), and the [query
string](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) has a word argument,
then the processing of the word occurs. If this is a postback, then it
is the user\'s data entry that the system processes. The term processing
means the browser submits the word to the back-end asynchronous web
services and renders each result.

Software quality is demonstrable in eight characteristics:
maintainability, functional suitability, performance efficiency,
compatibility, usability, reliability, security, and portability.

#### Maintainability

##### Corrective Maintenance

This is error correction.

##### Adaptive Maintenance

Transition from building console to web applications.

##### Perfective Maintenance

The author now considers partial and lookback scripture references. Such
as, when there is no book title, then this default to the earlier book
title.

Choosing the right [.NET Framework Data
Providers](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/data-providers#net-framework-data-provider-for-sql-server-sqlclient).
The author standardized on ODBC; the other choices are OLE DB, or
SQLClient.

##### Preventive Maintenance

Servicing the system to avoid larger mishaps.

#### Metric Quality Profiles

##### Unit Size Quality Profiles

Determining the AlphabetSequence takes 325 lines of code, which starts
and callbacks 40 lines of AJAX code and concludes with 200 lines of
database interaction. A unit of code should not exceed 15 lines.

All the web services (.asmx) files return JSON by default; the
AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx file, Query method, returns a hand
crafted JSON which has a numeric AlphabetSequenceIndex and a string
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference.

### The Twelve-Factor App {#the-twelve-factor-app datetime="2018-11-18T00:00:00"}

1.  Codebase: The WordEngineering application is storable in the
    [GitHub.com](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering) version
    control with a one-to-one mapping between the codebase and the
    application. There are multiple but separate websites that access
    the InformationInTransit.dll. The author builds the
    InformationInTransit.dll in the developer\'s working directory, and
    deploys the InformationInTransit.dll in each production\'s website
    bin directory. The steps for storing files in GitHub.com are:
    1.  git status
    2.  git add
    3.  git commit
    4.  git push
2.  Dependencies: The web.config file identifies the .net library
    versions that the environment should contain. The third-party
    supporting libraries are in the software bundle.
3.  Config: The web.config file contains the database connection
    strings; web services user specific credentials. The system
    adminstrator at external locations may customize these information
    for there specific use.
4.  Backing services: These are external independent resources, such as
    the database, SMTP.
5.  Build, release, run: These are the stages that a code goes through.
    Code compilation is deferrable for scripting, as opposed to
    compilable languages. Ever since the advent of the Java programming
    language, Just-In-Time (JIT) execution has been the norm.
6.  Processes: The author\'s earlier applications were stand-alone
    console applications that are run by the .NET Framework, later
    examples are the ASP.NET web pages and services. These applications
    run in a single thread, except they share static variables. The SQL
    Server encompasses services which are stoppable to do data files
    backup.
7.  Port binding: Web servers traditionally run on port 80, and SQL
    Server runs on the changeable port 1433. Javascript\'s Node and
    Python\'s Flask run on diversified ports.
8.  Concurrency: The author isolate his applications from the
    particulars of the base scaling concurrency choice.
9.  Disposability: The author\'s take on expendable work includes the
    following:
    -   Pure functions
    -   On-demand compilation of web pages and services
    -   Adjustable time-out setting for the database and web request
        threads
    -   The .NET Framework minute work, such as, the singleton design
        pattern, and static method calling and variable(s)
        initialization
10. Development/production parity: By first finalizing non repeatitive
    work, the author can now focus on specialization activities.
    -   The time gap: These include placing the common work in a central
        environment. Superseding the waterfall methodology with the more
        recent process, Agile and Scrum.
    -   The personnel gap: Dev/ops expertise
    -   The tools gap: The author prefers the stable infrastructure to
        the fly-by-night trends. Testing on the multiple operating
        systems and the various programming languages reflects the
        author\'s wish for compatibility. Prior to advent of the
        Internet, communication did not support a worldwide trend;
        therefore, the need for distributing scaling, that is remote
        applications depending on the scarce resources.
11. Logs: The author logs exceptions, that is, viewable in the Event
    Viewer. The author displays error messages to the user, the .NET
    Framework determines the detail, and the localhost address offers
    in-depth perculiarities.
12. Adminstration processes: These are one-off tasks that the
    environment demands of the knowledge worker. The tools are available
    everywhere for achieving the goal. Prior to graphical user interface
    (GUI), these are command-line responsibilities.

#### Who {#Who datetime="2022-02-08T12:21:00"}

The author gives credence to the information source. Whenever it is
possible, the author identifies the speaker. [ If the source is
attributable to him, the author rarely explicitly identifies himself.

#### What {#What datetime="2022-02-08T12:35:00"}

The primary contribution of the author is the word. The author draws
upon the word of God and tries to derive meaning.

#### When {#When datetime="2022-02-08T12:39:00"}

God gives most of His information in a dream, vision or face-to-face.

How do people place date? On each day of the week ( [Genesis
1-2](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%201-2)
)? Seniority comes first ( [John 1:15, John 1:27, John
1:30](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%201:15,%20John%201:27,%20John%201:30)
).

#### Where {#Where datetime="2022-02-08T12:43:00"}

The author refers to the physical location or scenery of participation.

#### Why {#Why datetime="2022-02-08T12:47:00"}

The endeavor of the author is to share the word.

### Artificial Intelligence {#ArtificialIntelligence}

#### Deep Learning {#DeepLearning}

Utterances are storable in the Word column of the HisWord table. An
expressible event is storable in the Commentary column. The information
relay is the basis for more computation in the HisWord_View and
Remember_View tables.

"[]{cite="#bibliographyIanGoodfellow2016"}"

##### Machine Learning {#MachineLearning}

Our entirety chiefly pertains to Him.

###### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) {#MultilayerPerceptron}

DateDifference.html is browser computation, built on JavaScript. The
overall function calls particular functions for determining the days
difference in the Biblical and Gregorian Calendar.

DateDifference.aspx is a server-side C# ASP.NET web form.

The Remember\'s table computed columns are Transact-SQL and SQL-CLR
functions.

Our computation is separable to back-end and forward-end code residence;
SQL-CLR provides the opportunity to have functionality callable from
both parts.

Code re-use sounds good, but it is dependent on many factors.

###### Feature {#Feature}

He addressed time. Each information the author measures is a feature
that the author appraises. The features are the words spoken and the
events seen.

###### Factors of Variation {#FactorsOfVariation}

These are out of context attributes that influence the outcome. Outside
the context of managing. Their influence is not determinable.

###### Depth of the Computational Graph {#DepthOfTheComputationalGraph}

The author does ASCII code alphabet place summations. There is just not
one result, but a set of alternatives; the user may select the most
right. For example, AlphabetSequence, produces an index and a scripture
reference. The depth in the case of AlphabetSequence is two, with the
first result, index, acting as an entry to the second result, scripture
reference. The index is an arithmetic calculation, addition; the second
result, scripture reference, is a composition algorithm that includes
determining the beginning and end span, for the chapter and verse.

###### Depth of the Probabilistic Modeling Graph {#DepthOfTheProbabilisticModelingGraph}

This checks the path to our succession, the thread between concepts.
Earlier and recent entries are comparable. The earlier Bible versions
serve as a resource for the later versions of the Bible.

### Probability {#Probability}

Formerly, the HisWord\'s table primary key is its Word column, and in
SQL Server the maximum size of a unique key is 900 bytes; therefore, the
limit of its distinct entries is 900 \^ (2 \^ 8) = 900 \^ 256 =
1.932334983228891510545406872202e+756.

#### Degree of Belief {#DegreeOfBelief}

In
[GetAPage.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html)
the author will consider the word(s) AlphabetSequenceIndex and
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference. The AlphabetSequenceIndex and
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference correlate. Each word is a
feature, however, hidden and has a contributing influence on the result.

In the BibleWord section, the author will look at each word, in the
context of the sentence, and see if it is in the Bible, as a phrase or
word combination.

In the BibleDictionary section, the author will explain the meaning of
each word. The degree of belief is most certain; since we display each
word found in the Bible dictionaries.

#### [Frequentist Probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability) {#FrequentistProbability}

In
[GetAPage.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html)
the same input will produce the same result; because the database is
consistent. When the user enters a new word, this trains the system.

WordEngineering started out as the author trying to use the Bible to
decipher God\'s word; however, to do growth, personalization,
customization, appeal to more audience. Our task is to see them, say, [
I done ( [John
19:30](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%2019:30)

#### [Bayesian Probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability) {#BayesianProbability}

Making specific, a generalization; given one result set, can the author
make a general result? Does it stand the test of a general audience?
Does a sample, qualify for the total?

#### [Random_variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) {#RandomVariables}

The AlphabetSequenceIndex may range between 1 and (8000 \* 26),
1\...208000; 8000 being the largest length of a SQL Server VARCHAR
datatype column, and the count of alphabets being 26. This is a discrete
set; since it is finite.

#### [Probability Mass Functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function) {#ProbabilityMassFunctions}

Each sentence will give the same result, and this value is a weighted
value of the result set; please note that vowels are probably more
popular than consonants, and parts of speech have different frequencies
of occurrences.

(Ian Goodfellow, 2016) "[]{cite="#bibliographyPeterBruce2017"}"

### Statistics Terms

#### Key Terms for Data Types

##### Continuous

The Dated column is a valid DateTime, and generally, it is ongoing,
rarely does the author backdate.

##### Discrete

The identity columns and AlphabetSequenceIndex are integer values; that
fall into a small unique set.

##### Categorical

The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference is of the scripture
reference type, and it is a string.

##### Binary

The Testament column is either Old or New.

##### Ordinal

The identity columns are all ordinal, following an ascending order.

#### Key Terms for Rectangular Data

##### Data frame

The data storage is a relational database; other options include
spreadsheet, comma separated value (CSV), eXtensible mark-up language
(XML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format.

##### Feature {#feature}

The most important predictor columns are the Word, Dated, and ContactID.

##### Outcome

The dependent columns include the AlphabetSequenceIndex,
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference and FromUntil date difference.

##### Records

A row in a spreadsheet is comparable to a database table record.

"[This technology will make all the before and current versions of the
code accessible, re-viewable, and

the author hears while sleeping are recordable and the author has never
had any tendency to alter this utterance from the LORD. When the author
is awake and he says something, out of his own volition and
pre-meditation, he has massaged this information, but now he rarely does
so. The words in the past and future event dates are useful for
remembrance entries. As the author technically matures, he automates
manual work.

The dreams are re-collect-able, and recallable ( [Numbers

The Bible fits man\'s perception. The author adapts to what he learns.

#### Project Management {#ProjectManagement}

The author is querying the Bible database. The first step of work is to
store the Biblical text in an electronic medium. The second step of work
is to create an application layer that will access this information in a
non-proprietary format. The on-going work is to present as relevant
today.

    user views by the use of, for example, Media Queries.
2.  Single Page Application (SPA) will circumvent the unit of
    navigation.
3.  Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is supportable by other means of
    specifying information, such as Global Positioning System (GPS)
    Geo-Location.
4.  Clients such as browsers store information on cookies, local and
    session storage.

The .NET Framework, C# and SQL Server support the Common Era; the date
ranges between 0001-01-01 and 9999-12-31. The date difference will
display correctly for the time interval - days, Biblical Calendar, and
all the dates after the introduction of the Gregorian Calendar.

#### Declarative {#Declarative}

SQL, Linq, CSS are declarative languages, but JavaScript is a functional
language.

#### Contextual {#Contextual}

Enhancements to JavaScript, such as const and let influence hoisting. So

### Continuous {#Continuous}

Placing the [App_Offline.htm](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/426755)
file in the virtual directory of the web application will shut-down the
application, unload the application domain from the server, and stop
processing any new incoming requests for the application.

A single batch file, with a single command line, builds the only .dll,
InformationInTransit.dll\
` csc /out:InformationInTransit.dll /target:library /recurse:*.cs /reference:System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.dll,"bin\Debug\HtmlAgilityPack.dll","bin\Debug\iTextSharp.dll","bin\Debug\MongoDB.Bson.dll","bin\Debug\MongoDB.Driver.dll","bin\Debug\MongoDB.Driver.Core.dll","bin\Debug\Newtonsoft.Json.dll","C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\WPF\PresentationFramework.dll","bin\Debug\System.Speech.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.Dmf.Adapters.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.Dmf.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.DmfSqlClrWrapper.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Sdk.Sfc.dll",Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll /nowarn:162,168,219,618,649 /unsafe `\
After testing, InformationInTransit.dll is deployable to the
WordEngineering\'s virtual directory, bin sub-directory. This transfer
is via the xcopy command or the Microsoft Windows Explorer user
interface (UI).

When the content of a server-side file with an .aspx or .asmx extension
changes, the ASP.NET framework automatically re-compiles for serving
future requests.

[jQuery](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js) by John Resig is for
making Ajax calls to the server. The more recent fetch command is also
useful in later cases. jQuery helps to load the latest copy of the
author\'s JavaScript repository
[9432.js](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.js);
since browser caching occurs for JavaScript files for a length of time.

The single .css file
[9432.css](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.css)
is callable at the bottom of each .html file\'s head node; JavaScript
statements are in the last lines of the .html files. This means that the
browser knows how to show the HTML elements before reaching their
origination, and the browser\'s JavaScript engine will not reference a
HTML node before the declaration of its definition.

[Set a Database to Single-user
Mode](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/set-a-database-to-single-user-mode?view=sql-server-2017#TsqlProcedure)

            ALTER DATABASE WordEngineering
            SET SINGLE_USER
            WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
            GO
            ALTER DATABASE WordEngineering
            SET READ_ONLY;
            GO

            SET MULTI_USER;     
                

If the research of the author is a team effort; the additional expense,
time and effort, in staged deployments, is justifiable; such as
development, test, production phases.

The author will place non-Microsoft DLLs in the virtual directory bin
sub-directory, and the author will refer to Microsoft DLLs in the
web.config file.

The web.config is generally consistent across deployment, the only
variable is the database server name, and when the application and
database server exists on the same machine, the connectionStrings may
use Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=master;Integrated Security=SSPI.
This means that the author will explictly specify the database, object
owner, and system object name. The Application pool will take care of
the security. There are no environment variables, in use, at this time.
The HTML files, when calling web services, will specify the full virtual
directory path, but when appending css and JavaScript files, relative
directories will suffice, full path directory and filename is
unnecessary and an overkill.

The author standardized on Microsoft SQL Server as the relational
database of choice. There are several alternatives in the market. All
database interaction goes through one access point,
[DataCommand.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/InformationInTransit/DataAccess/DataCommand.cs),
only this single file needs re-work if there is a database variety
change.

When running a unit of code, for the first time, it will initialize the
static variables. The
[ScriptureReference.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html)
will issue a unique quote-of-the-day, every day; and a random quote,
every time. The author program uses the release version of jQuery, which
is the most up-to-date. The web services, such as, Sefaria.org, should
not need code-revisit. The code in the third-party libraries, such as,
Newtonsoft.Json.dll, is consistent, and should rarely need
re-deployment.

The application is mostly stateless except for the database read.

Internet Information Server (IIS) HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) by
default runs on port 80, like other web servers, but this is modifiable.

Using the current architecture, the author takes care of concurrency and
deadlocks; because database writes rarely occur and are short, reads are
tolerant.

The threads are simple and conclusive; therefore, there are small
start-up and short-down periods.

There is unity between the development and production team, environment,
and time frame. The same knowledge worker can write, deploy, and run
code.

The author has experience, reporting web server logs, using
[WebTrends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webtrends). The author relies
on [Event Viewer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Viewer) for logging
and monitoring exceptions. The SQL Server Management Studio offers the
Error Log, for viewing the database activities.

The SQL Server Maintenance Plan is for scheduling full database and
transaction log backup, periodically.

"[]{cite="#bibliographyCraigMullins2000"}"

To reduce database load, the author considers the selection operation -
where clause, distinct and top; projection operation - specify the
column list, and not use the universal \*, for all columns. Rarely does
the author join tables, minimizing the work and resultset, in a
set-level language.

### HTML5 {#HTML5}

#### Semantic Elements {#SemanticElements datetime="2020-05-05T00:00:00"}

The author makes heavy use of the table semantic element for rendering
tabular information. The author uses the input element and specifies
either the text, number or date type attribute. The author tries the
canvas and video elements for proof-of-concept.

#### Non-Semantic Elements {#NonSemanticElements datetime="2020-05-05T00:00:00"}

The div and span elements are for rendering block and in-line
information. The author uses the div as a container for the ubiquitous
result set; which may contain a single or multiple tables. [The span is
a space for a non-block display.]{datetime="2020-10-06T14:28:00"}

Wake-up orientation database table

This information is currently being interpreted textually. An image, and
even more so, a video of the changes in position and direction when
sleeping will offer better insight. For the visually implied, the less
bandwidth-intensive text may still be satisfactory.

Non-Alphabetic

AlphabetSequence may not be appropriate for people that use glyphs or
sign languages.

Structured query language (SQL)

The proposed changes which will offer query customization?

-   The author transitioned from a multi-column query to a single-line
    query which has a tendency to return more results because it is not
    particular. Context fine-tuning is a suggestion.
-   With search-engine queries, the author proposes a query-language.
    This potentially affords better resultset granularity restriction,
    arrangement option, and maturity of use compensation.

### Data Science A Hands-On Introduction {#DataScienceAHandsOnIntroduction}

This research largely deals with structured data that is put into a
relational database. The word is easily associable with a table. The
dated column is when the word occurs. The scripture reference column is
the guide to the Bible. The columns contain numerical and categorical
data. The numbers are the sequence and date columns. The categories are
textual and these include the URI, location and scenery columns.

Humans are familiar with the recording of information into tables. The

GetAPage.html is Bible specific.

#### Parent Scripts and Objects

GetAPage.html contains the HTML5 directive, head, and body sections. The
head section contains the title and meta tags for search-engine
optimization (SEO). The 3 languages that make up a web page are in the
following ascending order: CSS, HTML, JavaScript.

HTML is an element\'s nodes. There are only single instances of the
input and submit elements. There are multiple div containers for the
result sets. Although HTML supports attributes, the ID attribute is the
author\'s only general declaration.

Both CSS and JavaScript act on HTML tags. JavaScript and CSS render the
contents of HTML.

There are minute uses of global variables. The author discourages this,
because of encapsulation and debugging traceability and granularity.

#### Naming Conventions

JavaScript relaxes variable declarations. Variables do not need explicit
declaration, and these declarations are redefinable. In spite of this,
the author is judicious about variables. The data- attribute is user
customizable.

### Literature Review {#LiteratureReview datetime="2022-09-12T14:04:00"}

Reading improvement? The literature review and bibliography sections are
scanty and brief. The justification of the author is that in the
Internet age the references and content are available on-line, and
putting into words other people\'s work is not the author\'s core
strength. When the author recounts non-original thoughts, the author
mentions this.

1.  2025-01-15T15:22:00 Data: It is primarily the word of God, in the
    WordEngineering database, HisWord table, Word column. With
    supportive information in the other columns on the HisWord table.
    The information in the other tables, such as, the Remember, APass,
    ActToGod tables are extractable and computable from the HisWord
    table.
2.  2025-01-15T15:29:00 Teachable: Can a student learn to generate this
    data, as you have? The only pre-requisite is the Holy Spirit.
3.  2025-01-15T15:42:00 Textual: The author hears the word. The author
    is able to transcribe the words. The accent of the author is not
    fluent. The author is not artistically inclined, nor trained at
    capturing and transmitting audio or video.
4.  2025-01-15T16:02:00 Customization: How is this word supposed to be
    used? When the author receives the word, he makes effort to
    temporarily record the word on paper. At a convenient time, the
    author records the word on a computer electronically.

1.  2025-02-08T22:32:00 Going along with the prognosis of the LORD, I
    feel my best utilization at the moment is to re-cap my history. To
    look at how I technically made decisions, in light of the spirit.
    With Chuck Missler as a mentor, he led information technology
    companies, and tutored Bible classes. Not to explain the Bible, but
    give an understanding of scripture. I found out at PowerSoft that my
    software engineering skills were not fully developed during my
    Master\'s degree programme at the University of Technology, Sydney
    (UTS). It may be that I did understand the paradigm shift,
    client/server, or specifically, PowerBuilder? Master-slave lacking.
    I had not led a team software project, nor taught a non-technical
    female student to transition into software engineering. These
    opportunities and challenges to train a female prodigy include:
    -   The Iranian Persian female student at Central Piedmont Community
        College (CPCC), personal computer (PC) laboratory 3 Pascal
        programs.
    -   Teaching Hajara Adeola a French lecturer, the wife of Fola
        Adeola, the co-founder of Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB), how to use
        a personal computer (PC).
    -   Helping Jenny Stevens of Powersoft with how-to use a
        client/server tool as a spreadsheet.
2.  -   At Electronic Data Systems (EDS)/Westpac the reference table had
        a composite primary key that consisted of major and minor
        columns.
    -   At Daigaku Honyaku Center (DHC) the reference table I wrongly
        implemented as a singleton instance.
3.  Up-to-now, what I have are raw ideas which need refinery expertise.

The 3 private sectors jobs I held in Charlotte, North Carolina (NC)
were:

1.  At Sunhealth Corporation, I upgraded a Microsoft Basic application
    to add columns to a printed report. Frank Veale worked on a database
    application for dating.
2.  At Central Corporation, I upgraded a Borland Turbo C application to
    generate an additional tape print label.
3.  At McKey Real Estate, I worked on a R:base 5000 application.

Initially, I registered the trademark, WordEngineering. After offering
me a book, Ocean Senior, I afterwards, was issued the domain name,
www.JesusInTheLamb.com. ( [Revelation 21:23, Revelation 21:2, Revelation

). At Baynet.com, I learned how to use Microsoft VisualStudio, and how
to develop using dynamic link libraries (DLL). This method I applied at
Daigaku Honyaku Center (DHC). I also copied code from ASP.NET Unleashed
by Stephen Walthers. These were prior to Microsoft introducing Microsoft
.NET Framework 3.5 and with it Language Integrated Query (LINQ) and
ASP.NET Model--view--controller (MVC). 2024-10-19T03:47:00 What

-   Who is the quote from? Whose words am I reciting? Most words I give
    the Holy Spirit credit for. But if I recognize the voice, or I heard
    the person speak, then I record the contact. If this is a word from
    scripture, then I attribute the reference. 2024-10-17T21:38:00 [I

    In the 1st scene, at Albertsons Lucky, Charter Square, in the

    They were arranged in vertical rows, and horizontally placed. They
    contained aged, broken and cheaper cookies. They were priced at 3
    for 9. In the 2nd scene, I was waiting on a public transport bus. A
    bus passed eastward. Other buses followed. I got on a bus, which was
    co-incidentally going towards my destination. When I got off the
    bus, inside a room, in the center, I saw uncle Jimi. It was the
    celebration of the birthday of aunt Taiwo. My twin sibling did not
    drive aunt Taiwo to the venue, since my twin sibling had other
    commitments. In the 3rd scene, inside a car in the south-east, a man
    spoke the words to me.

### Relational Model {#RelationalModel datetime="2024-05-24T04:34:00"}

1.  The author progressed from authoring disparate HTML files to
    recording information in a relational database.
2.  This transition offers an opportunity to analyze tables, columns and
    rows.
3.  Functional dependencies of relationships between columns are
    determined.
4.  The Word column in the HisWord table is a determinant but, it is not
    always unique; therefore, it is not its primary key.

#### View {#RelationalModel_View datetime="2023-06-29T20:22:00"}

A view is a virtual table that does not reside permanently on a physical
storage. The MyURI view is a union of all the URI tables. The
ViewContactSet view is a join of the columns in the Contact and contact
details tables. The HisWord_view view appends computed columns to the
HisWord table.

#### Users {#RelationalModel_Users datetime="2023-06-30T03:16:00"}

Scalability: The users have various options for sizing up their work.
The author did not initially restrict the size of the data queried from
the server; therefore, there was information overload on the data grid
of the client. The tolerance for large data may be exacerbated
vertically and/or horizontally. There may be a high count of rows or
columns, thereby, demanding ranking and preferences for positioning.

0.  The foundation rule: Since 2002, the author has adopted the
    relational model for storing his data. The author structures his
    data and queries his data by using the Structured Query Language
    (SQL).
1.  The information rule: The physical store is the HisWord table\'s
    Word column. This information is later processed logically in the
    HisWord_View.\

    dissertation files (.html, .txt, .pdf) from the Windows operating
    system computer to the UNIX operating system computer Linux variety.
    I also read the counter-style of each file.
2.  The guaranteed access rule: Specifying the primary key restriction
    in the where clause makes each datum reachable.\

    -   Identity columns cannot be null
    -   DateTime type columns will default to the system\'s datetime
    -   The columns that are part of a primary key cannot be null
4.  Dynamic online catalog based on the relational model:\
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA offers metadata, and it is questioned via SQL.

1.  User-facing: A user enters a received word, and there is a set of
    tabular responses.
2.  Functional: This is a Single Page Application (SPA) that depends on
    AJAX, and it calls multiple web-services.
3.  Behavioral: There are associations between the word and the Bible
    and the dictionaries\' object-oriented classes and entities.
4.  Independent: This is a composite of previous stand-alone work.
5.  Purposive: Based on user input, the system retrieves data, while
    also allowing further queries.
6.  Reusable: The idea is to retrieve information from a set of sources
    and send the results to various destinations.
7.  Valuable: The data is free, and the work is non-complex.

        knowledge.
    -   Maturity and relevance to our time

    Choosing a closer relationship with God.

### This data\...where does it exist? {#ThisDataWhereDoesItExist datetime="2024-04-02T15:45:00"}

Legacy storage of some data types is unnecessary, since this data is
computable. For example, concordances are automatically determinable.
Dictionaries that contain the meaning of words are available on-line.
Computers provide up-to-date versions and translations.

How-to display the data? After determining the
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference the author currently retrieves
and displays in particular the King James Version (KJV) Bible text, and
the author provides a hyperlink to a scripture reference page for
displaying other Bible versions. This practice follows Google\'s display
of a Wikipedia\'s sidebar and providing a hyperlink to the particular
Wikipedia url. For Bible literates, this regurgitation may be redundant.
What programming skills are in demand?

1.  Issuing a SQL select, and using a cursor to loop through a tabular

### A Comparance of Age {#a-comparance-of-age datetime="2017-03-06T00:00:00" contactid="8597" hiswordid="90849" commentary="Client/Server, TCP/IP" location="Alvarado Boulevard between Highway 880 overhead bridge and Starbucks, 32340 Alvarado Boulevard, Alvarado Place 32200-32340 Alvarado Road, the intersection of Alvarado Road and Galaxy Drive.

Divided as separated. Go this way, that way.

I want to program, but I don\'t want to match two programs together,
except for deep thought.

See when God grants increase; such as in creation, when God counts the
days, and separates it into evening and morning. Increase versus
decrease were first explicitly mentioned during Noah\'s flood. These
differences in size we can associate with signs - the sun and the moon.
During the day, you need the sun for your activities; during the
evening, it is not necessary. Rachel\'s prayer, and naming of Joseph;
Joseph\'s dreams and interpretations. These counting is explicit, before
Exodus, such as, the 10 plagues of Egypt ( [Genesis 37:5-11, Genesis
30:24, Genesis
40-41](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2037:5-11,%20Genesis%2030:24,%20Genesis%2040-41)
).

[TCP/IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) is
separable into four layers; these are the link, Internet, transport and
application layers. No breaking ( [Matthew
19:8](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%2019:8)
).

#### Marriage

Marriage is not a practice, in the life after, resurrection ( [Matthew
22:30, Mark 12:25, Luke 20:35, Revelation 21:2, 2 Corinthians
11:2](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%2022:30,%20Mark%2012:25,%20Luke%2020:35,%20Revelation%2021:2,%202%20Corinthians%2011:2)
). Co-incidentally, the disciple, who Jesus love, John the apostle, does
not mention this event, in the Gospel of John. [ [It is more of a father
that wants

]{datetime="2022-04-21T08:40:00"} Jesus resurrected, after three days (
[Matthew 12:40, Matthew 26:61, Matthew 27:40, Matthew 27:63, Mark 8:31,
Mark 14:58, Mark 15:29, Luke 2:46, John 2:19, John 2:20, 2 Corinthians
11:2, Revelation 21:2, Revelation 21:9, Revelation

). The breaking of device ( [Psalms 34:20, John
19:36](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Psalms%2034:20,%20John%2019:36)
).

On the client, HTML is content, CSS is presentation, and JavaScript is
behavior. Both ASPX and ASMX are server-side logic.

The application tier is in a dynamic link library (DLL), and it is
separable into client, database, and application logics, but with the
advent of language integrated query (Linq), this delineation is slowly
diminishing. Linq rivals previous division of labor.

The database consists of tables, views, indexes, constraints, stored
procedures and functions. These programming logic may be SQL or SQLCLR.
SQL critics complain that while the rest of software development have
progressed, we still use an archaic language; NoSQL is a challenger.

#### Visibility ( [John 4](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%204) )

The client is accessible from the browser, both the user interface and
the source code, along with the errors and exceptions. The interface is
made-up of request and response. Text-to-Speech will aid the people with
poor visibility. The client handles the human computer interface (HCI).
The Bible versions are selectable options in HTML or JavaScript.

The database contains the real information, that makes-up the result
set.

#### Lifecycle ( [John 3:3, John 3:7](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%203:3,%20John%203:7) )

In computing, we have had mainframes and terminals, client/server,
Internet, mobile and now cloud. The trend has been from proprietary to
open architecture.

#### Accompany ( [Matthew 4:6, Matthew 18:10](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%204:6,%20Matthew%2018:10) )

What are the pairing?

The client started as HTML, but now has JavaScript and CSS.

CGI originally served the back-end. Flash and plug-ins have made way for
other technology, such as HTML5 video and canvas.

JSON and XML have made in-roads.

2.  Quality Assurance (QA): Some changes break existing code.

    SQLCLR, is in use.

#### Information Flow {#information-flow datetime="2020-08-04T21:00:00"}

"[Sharing His word; is following His
deed.]{cite="#bibliographyCharlesMKozierok2003-2017"}" (Charles M.
Kozierok).

With .asmx web services, the author, standardized on JSON for returning
data. The alternative is XML. The preference for JSON, is because of its
lighter payload. Another difference, in the result set, the author
chooses if to return a dataset, datatable, or scalar? The datatable is
useful for a singular resultset. With SQL Query select statements, the
column list may refer to \*, for returning all the columns, in the order
they are arranged in the container, table or view; or otherwise the
stricter, specification of each column to return. The author restricts
which rows to return, by issuing the conditional where clause; the top 1
select clause is useful, for quote of the day; as it supercedes the set
rowcount 1, limitation. The author depends on the database order by
clause, for sorting in ascending or descending order, Data is also
rankable by clicking on the table\'s column header.

##### Basic Communication Modes of Operation {#basic-communication-modes-of-operation datetime="2020-08-07T22:15:00"}

The author\'s SQL Server TCP/IP is turned off; because the author does
not want interference from the outside. The author imposes an artificial
Simplex Operation; only supporting external read requests, and not
allowing updates; which is a one-way traffic of data from the server to
the clients. The other options are Half-Duplex Operation and Full-Duplex
Operation.

##### Quality of Service (QoS) {#quality-of-service-qos datetime="2020-08-07T22:53:00"}

Most of the author\'s web pages transmit textual data; but a few pages
offer text-to-speech or video capabilities; these rare application rely
on high-grade speciality. The author as a programmer does not meddle
with these intricacies; the technology provider takes care of the
nitty-grity.

##### Parameter Standardization {#parameter-standardization datetime="2020-08-10T06:21:00"}

The column name is kept consistent in the query string, up-to the naming
convention and the case-sensitivity; this also applies to where we
specifically refer to a column name in JavaScript. This is most seen, in
the Scripture reference and Bible word variables, which the author
shares around.

##### Global Resource Allocation and Identifier Uniqueness {#global-resource-allocation-and-identifier-uniqueness datetime="2020-08-10T06:42:00"}

The domain name is unique to the organization; and the Javascript code
for AJAX explicitly mentions the virtual directory; the internet
provider issues the IP address.

### Productivity {#WriteGreatCodeVolume3EngineeringSoftwareChapter2ProductivityByRandallHyde datetime="2023-04-05T19:55:00" url="http://www.RandallHyde.com"}

1.  Productivity is the measure of unit tasks completed within a time
    frame or at a cost.
2.  A project cost is its work hours. A work day is 8 hours. A work
    month is ≈176 work hours. A work year is ≈2000 work hours.
3.  The degree of conceptual complexity increases when an expression
    contains various function calls and many parentheses. Scope
    complexity is the fitting between parts.
4.  To predict productivity? Re-use.
5.  Metric:
    -   Executable Size Metric: Is the code largeness. It does not fully
        consider the uninitialized array data. It includes library code
        which reduces complexity. It is not a language-independent
        source. It is not CPU-independent.
    -   Machine Instructions Metric: This is the size or count of the
        machine instructions.
    -   Lines of Code Metric (LOC): It counts the number of source code
        lines. It is consistent across programming languages. It is
        CPU-independent. The Linux word count, wc, command will suffice.
    -   Statement Count Metric: It excludes comments, blank lines, and
        counts as 1 a statement that spreads across multiple lines.
    -   Function Point Analysis (FPA): It looks ahead and assumes the
        amount of work a program will require. It details the inputs,
        outputs and basic computation. FPA has become a postmortem
        (end-of-project) tool.
    -   McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity Metric developed by Thomas
        McCabe: It finds out the complexity by determining the paths
        through it.

1.  Intelligibility of nature: Words were part of his life.
2.  Order in nature: To digest what has been and reckon what will be.
3.  Contingency of nature: To take one\'s own as one\'s possibility.

### Understanding is achievable {#UnderstandingIsAchievable datetime="2023-03-30T20:59:00" url="returnofthegodhypothesis.com/media/shorts"}

1.  Observe: Read the Bible and record words spoken.
2.  Test: Compare the words in the Bible with the words heard.
3.  Measure: Apply metrics to gain closeness.

The software is available at <http://github.com/KenAdeniji>. These
include the source code and the data definition language (DDL). For size
and privacy reasons, the data manipulation language (DML) is not
available to the general public. The Bible versions, dictionaries and
commentaries are available in the public domain. The author concedes
that the length of the source code is large, but it is easily readable.

Strategy

Description

Focus on quantity

AlphabetSequence includes the whole Bible. The author has not expanded
the 2-words nor 3-words computation.

Wait to judge

AlphabetSequence is relevant to the English language and the King James
Version (KJV) Bible?

Think outside the box

While the initial focus was on the Bible, written word; research now
includes spoken word.

Combine and improve ideas

The author solicits input from others.

Keep focus on the problem

Database recording resulted from the effort to determine when? The
author has concentrated on this timeline.

### Decision-screening Matrix {#DecisionScreeningMatrix datetime="2023-08-02T15:28:00"}

The AJAX approach offers the following benefits in performance criterion
and weight:

-   Ease of manufacture
-   Engineering skill needed to build
-   Robust design
-   Primary function independence

The competing solution will include:

-   Server-side JavaScript, for example, Node
-   Front-end library and framework, for example, React

The load time, and response time to user action and submission. The
author tested the time, it takes to load each page, after development;
and the wait period was satisfactory. For the Bible database, the author
does not expect further increase in database size, which will put
premium on the load. [Ahmdal\'s

### Progress

After the author conceived the notion for AlphabetSequence, he stored
the word spoken into XML files, along with manually determining the
relevant Bible word. This, the author did, because the author thought
and felt that the readers will prefer to read the recent information,
and they do not have to regurgitate the entire database. The author was
living at Newark, and working from Fremont.

The author recorded, the FromUntil Time Span, explicitly into the
Remember\'s table commentary column. Now, there are three computed
columns, managing this period(s); these are the days difference, the
Biblical time period, and Common Era computation. The author is saving
memory storage space this way. And, also offering the opportunity to
other people, the possibility to calculate their preferred period.

Using the knowledge learnt from horizontal replication and partition,
the audience are no longer forced to accept the author\'s calendar. The
audience can choose their acceptable fact, and ignore nor standard
derivation.

The history, this way, is to say; at the begining, the author will
record every entry after six p.m. as the next day saying, just like the
Jewish day starts at 6 p.m. With the reasoning advent, the Tanakh, the
New Testament, and the Koran, the truth partiality, is our governance.

### The Basic of Facilitating the Truth

Most words have precedence, and do not exist in an emptiness. Words
follow a trend. Are their supportive collaboration, to the utterance the
author hears; these are linkable for historical evidence.

How do we give our actualities? I have found written text, the easiest
and most applicable way of sharing thoughts. Words spoken, when passed
from generation to generation, may gain legend status, and therefore,
lose appropriateness.

Examine the course of history? You will find, that most truth, are
actually realizing the dream. In my case, when I try to recall, the
past, I search by keywords, numbers and dates. So, entries in the word,
are most to realization. The first words spoken have higher importance
and closer affinity; so also, prophetic application, have standard
occurrence.

Our work, so much depends on data entry. The Remember table relies on
relationship, deductive reasoning.

### Can we look back at history, as we precede our future

#### An angel said to prophet Daniel, many shall run to and fro ( [Daniel 12:4](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Daniel%2012:4) )

Is this phenomenal traceable, Biblically, and can we name a person that
bears similar resemblance? When we study, king David, we can see that
David fled from king Saul, his predecessor; and two of his biological
immediate sons, who purported, to overthrow him as king. In the Book of
Revelation, the only three mentions of king David, talk of movement (
[Revelation 3:7, Revelation 5:5, Revelation
22:16](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Revelation%203:7,%20Revelation%205:5,%20Revelation%2022:16)
). [ Joseph ( [Genesis 37:2, Genesis 37:9, Genesis 37:19, Genesis
39:12-18](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2037:2,%20Genesis%2037:9,%20Genesis%2037:19,%20Genesis%2039:12-18)
). ]{datetime="2022-07-22T15:25:00"}

#### Why we Accumulate the Same ( [Matthew 26:53, Revelation 9:16, Revelation 7:4-8](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%2026:53,%20Revelation%209:16,%20Revelation%207:4-8) )

Samuel anointed David, during king Saul\'s reign. The choice, one makes,
ahead ( [Genesis 2:2-3, 2 Samuel 11:4, 2 Samuel 12:24, Ruth 3:1, Ruth
3:8, Ruth
3:18](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%202:2-3,%202%20Samuel%2011:4,%202%20Samuel%2012:24,%20Ruth%203:1,%20Ruth%203:8,%20Ruth%203:18)
). Knew versus lay.

### Wanting a Member of\...

In the first words, in the Bible, God referred to the beginning, of His
work, giving time, an annotation. God also mentioned two places, heaven
and earth, creation generally centers on the activities on the earth;
and God we understand, resides in the heaven, the last point for good on
earth. To seek a development; it had a beginning.

In the second sentence, second verse, God mentions, that the earth was
without form and void; meaning the earth was without content. Nothing
was a member of the earth. Also, God\'s spirit, a member of God, moved
across the water.

When time is maximal used; time is ideal allowed. When our association
to follow; is association to the end.

The author will want a conciliation with time?

AlphabetSequence is a novice attempt to tie what the author hears to the
Bible. As one reads the Bible, they have a more familiar method of
communicating. As we begin today, how can we let tomorrow?

That is what we are trying to say, how can we make ample use of time?
Word of God. Word from God? The commentary is a human interpretation.
You can fit more into time, by making a luxury of time. Why do we have
to repeat the meaning in our words? Bible dictionary and commmentary. As
a result of who are we? When does the scenario introduce God ( [Genesis

Relational Database

After the introduction of the author to Microsoft SQL Server; the author
does not feel the need to adopt newer technology like object-oriented
database, nor nosql.

Server-side Programming, Back-end

The author learnt C#, and there has been no reason to adopt upgrades.
When Microsoft MVC learning is not necessary. The scripture reference
class offers partition for instantiation. The Microsoft platform is the
author\'s choice, although the migration to .NET core may be inevitable.

Programming Style

This lineage are passage. C# is object-oriented. JavaScript is
functional programming. SQL is declarative and imperative.

-   The Microsoft Windows Operating System offers the clipboard copy
    command. When using the Mozilla Firefox browser and copying the
    address bar, the author selectively only copies the domain name and
    leaves out the protocol when it is http or https. This saves storage
    space, since this is the default protocol. When copying information
    from the page, please note that there may be leading blank spaces,
    which requires truncation.

In Australia, I got involved with the prison ministry at the Villawood
Detention Center. The Christian missionaries that were serving felt that
fellow migrants might aid in responding to new applicants. I was
deported to my country of origin, Nigeria, from the United States of
America (USA); therefore, I could share the plight of these inmates. I
was also in the court process, so I could better understand Australia\'s
law. Finally, my most productive contract consulting was at the
Department of Training Education Committee (DTEC), so I had an
understanding of integrating and skilling re-locating workers. I tried
to share computer books, but inmates were undaunted by their relevance
to their misery. They were expected to write letters to immigration
officials. This influenced my desire to practice authoring Christian
literature and improve my communication. How could I relate to less
fortunate people? How may I be the one giving? How can I let the Holy
Spirit partake on my side? What are these roles for, and how will I be a
mediator? What do I share as a bargain? All these are words to say. What
do I mean as a human being? Where does the spirit hold its own?
Computers are programmable, humans are useful. Where does a side take
the rest? What I am finding out, is how necessary I am as a person? How
do I do my part in participating? What can you take from me, and make as
your own? My words may not be what you will say, but how can your
experience let you say? Imagine your life will be lived, as you say.
When the times, programming lines, lines of code, play out a scenario.
So words make meaning as sufficiency. Whose life have I lived to
complexity? To the full of His deed ( [John
15:24](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%2015:24)

"[The author will not break each experience into sequences. At this late
stage of the research, the author is content, with his original table
design, and will elaborate, when it is appropriate, to newer
suggestions.]{cite="#bibliographyJohnWhalen"}" (John Whalen).

### What do you want to use it for? {#WhatDoYouWantToUseItFor datetime="2021-06-07T21:09:00"}

It is firstly, a database work. That is the author records God\'s word.
What the author hears, he relates to the Bible and the other scriptural
sources. These information are all in database tables, giving the author
the luxury of using relational technology. The benefit includes storage
and archive, that is, the work is usable in tabular format. There is a
copy of the information running Microsoft SQL Server on a Linux
operating system; which the author switches to, by changing the database
connection string of one node in the web.config. When the user decides
to stabilize and admit no further changes; then there is no need to do
additional database update work. As with such work, the database schema
remains consistent, since the beginning. The choice of word, meets
today\'s expectations. The addition of the ActToGod table, demonstrates
the maturity of the author, [ since it advances from data to
information. ]{datetime="2024-04-25T17:49:00"}

The author, first wrote his history, in multiple stand-alone files
.HTML, .XML. ([Acts
7:22](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Acts%207:22)).
This documentation didn\'t allow for enough dating, to track creation
and change, nor easy querying. Therefore, the decision to move to a
relational database; that will augment this fact.

Since the beginning, the author wrote a ContactMaintenance.aspx
server-side page as a user-interface (UI) to record contact information.
This page remains active, till today.

The author uses Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to document
general information. When the author is offsite, text editors provides a
place to scribble data manipulation language (DML) statements into SQL
script files, for later execution. Please understand that both means
mentioned above do not always support the checking of spellings nor
grammar, and have limited formatting.

I have a product; where is the method?

Adoptability:

1.  What is the minimum requirement? The author believes it is the Holy
    Spirit spreading the Word, and it is not him, making up the word. As
    long as you have the spirit of God, then you are receptive to this
    information sharing. The word is not always clearly heard, and the
    sighting is not always 20/20 visibile.
2.  What is the literacy level requirement? If you know the alphabets
    arrangements, then you can determine the AlphabetSequenceIndex by
    hand. To determine the AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference, you
    need to know, the count of chapters and verses. This manual work
    gives way to computation, which is not error prone.
3.  The Biblical account wrote dreams and visions textually, without
    resorting to the database. Search Engines Crawlers parse the
    standard HTML files and rarely query the database. The calendar:
    years, months, days, may benefit from the stipulation and
    generability of the Common Era.
4.  Where is the world leading and how do we follow it? The author
    fiddles with the idea of bringing technology to the Word of God. The
    author is unaware of the start and early beginnings of dictionaries,
    concordance and commentaries; but the author gains from this works
    as a reference. The widely acception of a work, accompanies
    preference and prevalence.
5.  The result of the Bible, is how we use it. The emphasises of Jesus
    Christ and apostle Paul is the word for today? As the author sees
    from the Bible, Moses assigned intervention to leaders, and Moses
    went to God as a higher authority. Who is the work for? Who can
    benefit from reading this work?

-   To achieve performance beneficiary, the author uses AJAX, a single
    Javascript and CSS file, and minute images.
-   The author\'s work is largely based on the SQL\'s SELECT statement,
    a matured declarative language, which the author uses to query
    God\'s word.
-   The author relies on the Bible database, a recognized source of
    information, which has stood the standard of time.
-   The reason for AlphabetSequence is because the author lacks Biblical
    knowledge. The author sought for a way to reconcile what he is
    hearing with the established word.
-   The SQL COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() Functions are row-based.

Andre Nguyen asked how I spend my day?

When I started AlphabetSequence, I ate my only daily meal at 6PM, read
the Bible and went to bed. I could break my day into punctual scheduled
activities, such-as:

-   Wake-up
-   Brush my teeth and shower
-   Breakfast
-   Work
-   Lunch
-   Dinner
-   Bedtime

This is how most people, live their lives; this is what I have accepted
as mine. When I receive a word, I make it my work, to record the word
and personalize my entries. I try to match this new story segment, with
the preceding and forthcoming event threads.

When the author observes explicit experiences, he may record this

### God\'s Word; Human Interpretation {#GodsWordHumanInterpretation datetime="2021-01-12T14:30:00"}

The author separates the word of God from the supporting information:

-   Cast which fits into the Contact ID column
-   Scripture reference is the Biblical theme
-   Scenery which is the dream setting
-   Location which is an awake surrounding
-   Language translation

Specificity guides our entries into the HisWord table; for example if
the information is not explicit, do not record it. This means that the
nullable columns may be left empty. When there are more than one
possible entries, choose the most rare.

[What we do minimally, is how we do
enormously.](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=What%20we%20do%20minimally,%20is%20how%20we%20do%20enormously.){datetime="2021-07-13T09:51:00"}

God may put a thought or question in my mind, rather than sharing a
word? To know the need of revealing one another?

How do you, reference the Bible?

-   Search Engine? Requires Internet access.
-   [ScriptureReference.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html)
    Requires Bible knowledge and place in the Bible.
-   [BibleWord.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html)
    Requires word knowledge

What is the certaincy of the word:

-   When the author hears a word and there is a reference to a place in
    the Bible, this affirms the word\'s relevance to the Scripture.
-   Grammatically correctness is also vital.
-   If a word correlates with a historical event, then it is credible.
-   When the Spirit leads and guides towards an utterance ( [Matthew
    10:19-20](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%2010:19-20)
    ).
-   Where am I, resemblance of how I am made ( [1 Corinthians
    14](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=1%20Corinthians%2014)
    )?

What does He choose as example?

-   God rested on the Sabbath day ([Luke
    23:56](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%2023:56))
-   Jesus Christ ([Daniel 9:24-27, 1 Corinthians 15:45, 1 Corinthians
    15:47](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Daniel%209:24-27,1%20Corinthians%2015:45,%201%20Corinthians%2015:47))
-   Man such as King David ([2 Kings 14:3, 2 Kings 16:2, 2 Chronicles
    28:1, Amos
    6:5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=2%20Kings%2014:3,%202%20Kings%2016:2,%202%20Chronicles%2028:1,%20Amos%206:5))
-   Place such as Sodom ([Matthew 10:15, Matthew 11:23-24 , Mark 6:11,
    Luke 10:12, Luke 17:29, Romans 9:29, 2 Peter 2:6, Jude 1:7,
    Revelation
    11:8](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%2010:15,%20Matthew%2011:23-24%20,%20Mark%206:11,%20Luke%2010:12,%20Luke%2017:29,%20Romans%209:29,%202%20Peter%202:6,%20Jude%201:7,%20Revelation%2011:8)).
-   Other living things ([Numbers
    22:21-33](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Numbers%2022:21-33)
    ).

### To whose advantage am I?

In every scenario, we participate in, our last outcome should be holy (
[2 Samuel
12:14](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=2%20Samuel%2012:14)
). Future study, may consider the actors in the Bible, and award their
holiness in each scenario.

### Centeredness {#centeredness datetime="2017-03-21T07:33:00"}

This is our attempt to find follow-up, continuity in the Bible. A brief
repetition of our activities, subsequently. Firmer consequence ( [Isaiah
23:15, Isaiah 23:17, Jeremiah 25:11, Jeremiah 25:12, Jeremiah 29:10,
Daniel 9:2, Zechariah
7:5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Isaiah%2023:15,%20Isaiah%2023:17,%20Jeremiah%2025:11,%20Jeremiah%2025:12,%20Jeremiah%2029:10,%20Daniel%209:2,%20Zechariah%207:5)
). Listed below are some of the repeated reinforcements.

#### Samson\'s Birth ( [Judges 13](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Judges%2013) )

An angel of the LORD appears to the wife of Manoah and prophesy that she
will give birth to a Nazarite son ( [Judges
13:2-5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Judges%2013:2-5)
).

The same angel appears to Manoah and his wife ( [Judges
13:6-25](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Judges%2013:6-25)
). The angel reinforces the their responsibility and defers reverence to
God.

#### The Birth of the Messiah ( [Luke 1](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Lukev1) )

Foretelling the birth of John the Baptist ( [Luke 1:5-25, Malachi
4:5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%201:5-25,%20Malachi%204:5)
). Transitioning the present to the after ( [Luke
1:17](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%201:17)
).

Foretelling the birth of Jesus Christ ( [Luke
1:26-38](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%201:26-38)
). Continuing the Davidic line ( [Luke 1:32-33, 2 Samuel 7:12-13, 2
Samuel
7:16](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%201:32-33,%202%20Samuel%207:12-13,%202%20Samuel%207:16)
).

#### The Baptism of Cornelius ( [Acts 10](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Acts%2010) )

The Bible does not explicitly mention the citizenship of Cornelius, but
it mentions his rank as a centurion in the Italian band ( [Acts
10:1](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Acts%2010:1)
).

Simon Peter is a fisherman, but without the LORD\'s presence, fishery is
not sustaining ( [Luke 5:4-11, John 21:3-6, Matthew 17:24-27, Acts
10:9-16](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%205:4-11,%20John%2021:3-6,%20Matthew%2017:24-27,%20Acts%2010:9-16)
). What I bring to Him; is me alone, to value Him.

### Full Position {#FullPosition}

The first occurrence of the word, full, in the Bible, occurs in (
[Genesis
14:10](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2014:10)
); and is in reference to the vale of Siddim, which was full of slime
pits, and this is where the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell.
The father of the faithful, Abraham, died, full of years, and the son of
promise, Isaac, died, full of days ( [Genesis 25:8, Genesis
35:29](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2025:8,%20Genesis%2035:29)
); The last occurrence of the word, full, in the Bible, occurs in (
[Revelation
21:9](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Revelation%2021:9)
). Living a presence ( [Jeremiah
28:11](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Jeremiah%2028:11)
). To creating a future full of all. To creating a future free of all.

### One Chance; Seem the Rest. {#OneChanceSeemTheRest}

Our LORD\'s prayer is a communal prayer; directed to the one God (
[Matthew 6:9-13, Luke
11:2-4](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%206:9-13,%20Luke%2011:2-4)
). Please note that it is Jesus; teaching this prayer; so He doesn\'t
refer to Himself or the Holy Spirit explicitly; as in another passage,
when He mentions Himself as the bread ( [John
6:31-35](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%206:31-35)
). He explains the truth; that we may fall short of it, by explicitly
referring to the Father. He is alluding to the events in the apocalyptic
books, Daniel and Revelation. We are on earth, and we have an earthly
father; where we are, is not where, we wish and will to reside (
[Matthew 6:9, Luke 11:2, Daniel 2, Revelation
5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%206:9,%20Luke%2011:2,%20Daniel%202,%20Revelation%205)
). When no matter, where I go; this is how, I Am found ( [John
20:17](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%2020:17)
).

### To set everything true {#ToSetEverythingTrue}

The word,
[true](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=true),
occurs in seventy-seven verses in the Scripture Bible, and there are
eighty-one occurrences. True, first occurs in Joseph\'s interaction with
his brothers ( [Genesis 42:11, Genesis 42:19, Genesis 42:31, Genesis
42:33, Genesis
42:34](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2042:11,%20Genesis%2042:19,%20Genesis%2042:31,%20Genesis%2042:33,%20Genesis%2042:34)
); Jacob had colluded with Rebecca, his mother, to get Isaac, his
father\'s, blessing; God shows that Joseph will have elevation over his
parents and siblings. There are ten occurrences of the word, true, in
the book of (
[Revelation](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Revelation)
); in response, to God.

### To Whom Masculine?

How the Bible compares the gender?

#### Man, after his Fall

During Creation, God asked all living things, be fruitful and multiply;
God asked Adam to name the living creatures, and God required Adam to
take care of the Garden of Eden, but this taking care is to dress and
keep the garden; there is a role for man, the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, and the tree of life. God did not specify the welfare of
animals. Out of Adam, God made a helper for Adam, Eve.

After the Fall of Man, Adam\'s labor will be thorough; and there is
enmity between the serpent and Eve, and each other\'s seed; and Eve will
have pain, during child-birth.

God made coats of skins, and clothed them; it is our presumption, that
the clothing is from living things, generally perceived as sin
sacrificial animal(s), but since this clothing is not specified, an
alternative, is that it is a plant, or another creature entirely.

God created an adult male, Adam; and his female counterpart, Eve (
[Deuteronomy 2:14, John
5:5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Deuteronomy%202:14,%20John%205:5)
). There is no mention of Adam\'s activity, after the fall of man; as
Eve bares and name their children; Adam\'s earlier effort, which was to
cater for the Garden of Eden and name the animals.

#### Man at Birth

We can only suggest, that the struggle between good and evil, continues
upon the birth of Cain, Abel, and Seth. Eve named Cain, as her
possession; and Seth, as the appointed seed.

God instituted male circumcision, which should take place on the eighth
day, as man\'s responsibility in keeping the Abrahamic covenant.

At times, there is proclamation of a mantle, before livelihood; as in
the case of Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Samson, John the Baptist, and Jesus
Christ. In each example, there is a relationship between God and a
parent; and God is directing, the offspring\'s onus. The want similar to
Christ; is to see yourself, among fold.

#### Man\'s Task

Historical man\'s profession are keeper of sheep, a tiller of the
ground, handle the harp and organ, an instructor of every artificer in
brass and iron. Unlike the first men, in the Bible, Seth\'s service was
not identified, we only know that after the birth of Seth\'s son, Enos,
men began to call, on the name of the LORD.

The 10 Commandments details the relationship we aspire to have with God,
and our fellow-men.

God may consign men to overseer, as in the case of Melchizedek king of
Salem, the priest of the most high God, and collector of tithes; Joseph,
dreamer and interpreter, and he will save much life, in Egypt; as in
incorporating the end. We share among us; as no foundation separates us.

### Our choice is where we want to be? What we want to be?

A choice between what you have, and what you will want? ( [Revelation
5:5, Matthew 1:25, Luke 2:7, Romans 8:29, Colossians 1:15, Colossians
1:18, Hebrews 11:28, Hebrews
12:23](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Revelation%205:5,%20Matthew%201:25,%20Luke%202:7,%20Romans%208:29,%20Colossians%201:15,%20Colossians%201:18,%20Hebrews%2011:28,%20Hebrews%2012:23)
). Where I take you; is where you belong ( [Genesis 13:14-18,
Deuteronomy
34](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2013:14-18,%20Deuteronomy%2034)
).

The select inputs do not have default values.

The Scripture table is a one-to-one mapping between the Bible version
and column. These arrangements are futile when there are inconsistencies
in the Bibles versions separations. An alternative is to have a table
for each version. Publishers issue Bible version.

What does the Bible teach us about twins? Full-Text search? We have
given preference to the word, not the commentary, which is subjective.

1.  Issue a SQL database query statement

    This is the most raw form of querying the database, but it offers
    the most flexibility, and it does not restrict, to pre-built
    application.
2.  Navigate the web pages from a client browser

Such as, will a query language find the mother, father, and child
relationship?

#### WordToNumberHelper.cs

Numbers in the Bible are written out as words. The author made effort to
parse these words and find the numbers, but it was not totally
successful, largely because of the arrangement of the numerals.

#### Translate the Original AlphabetSequence C# Code to the Other Programming Languages

AlphabetSequence was first implemented in the C# programming language
[AlphabetSequence.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/InformationInTransit/ProcessLogic/AlphabetSequence.cs)
Later work, saw translation to:

#### Data Residence

Where should the data reside? Database, JSON or XML files?

#### Which side, the love felt?

SQL returns records in rows; there is a result set. Would we, be able,
to amalgate the result set? For example, how can we, find themes in the
Bible? When you enter a topic, can we return a trend? Clustering, can we
return a number; as its present ( [1 Kings
19:11-13](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=1%20Kings%2019:11-13)
)?

#### Where I arrive, is where He as conclusively use

Initially, when I got a word, I made efforts to expound, on this word;
but now, I share the word, and wait on God to reinforce the word, or
share a new theme.

2019-05-30 My ancestral home is Ile-Ife, the site of the Oranmiyan
staff. My search for the word,
[Staff](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=staff&logic=and),
inspired relating the Bible to my life. Staff, first occurs in, (
[Genesis
32:10](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2032:10)
). In my ninth year, my twin sibling and I, relocated from Ile-Ife Staff
School to Lagos. In our tenth year, we visited London. In my 32nd year,
I re-located to the United States of America (USA).

God intended man, to be a personal use. The work of the author is an
individual effort, and it targets a singular person. The author
separates his work into web pages, but the user may click on a
hyperlink, to get more information, and sometime do additional work. The
work of the author, builds on the efforts of other people, like the
Bible, dictionary and commentary. The HisWord table and associated
queries, only currently refers to the contribution of the author. How
could we, specialize our work? Who uses, and for what? The setting, is
it normal? What are the influence of God, as a person? What are His
contribution, solely to man? What part of Him, as He analyzed, as a
person? What role, as man, placed on Me? What stimulate you, as a human
being; is where My opinion placed? The author read the Bible and
listened to His word, prior to the introduction of AlphabetSequence.
Where do we follow, His partnership? He has said the word; I have
collaborated with Him.

#### Outstanding Work {#OutstandingWork}

The source code and schema are available at Github.com. This means that
the public can review and make updates to the original work of the
author. This aged work is not up-to-date with the industry trend, such
as cloud computing, mobile applications, decentralized ledger, nosql.
Part of the justification for this immaturity; is the need to maintain a
low entry point and capture a wide audience for its adoption.

Which is the information container? The ActToGod table, Major column
value, Comparative verse; supercedes the WordsInTheBible table; which is
the exact word for the King James Version (KJV) and not all versions of
the Bible; and doesn\'t take into consideration the English language
British versus American spelling, such as favour versus favor, nor the
generic word, such as, man versus men. When is this, anointing of the
Spirit ( [1 Samuel 2:26, Luke

Can you create a fictitious record in the Contact table, that meet later
fulfillment. This record in the contact table will contain a word that
is placeable in the title or company field/column. This information is
substantiable in the commentary column of the CaseBasedReasoning table.
This is compatible to Ghost city. A bit column is settable, for this
contact. It allows to keep the contact ID as a foreign key. A record to
be someone else.

The effort of the author is to share and comprehend the word of God.
What can the author provide to the other; to substantiate the work of
the author? God made man as similar to Him to see how life can be? If I
spoke the same, how am I the same? I know, I am. The love of being the
same supersedes feeling the same. Being in the spirit; is alluding to
the sufficiency of men.

## Terminology - Words and Meaning {#Terminology}

When you write a thesis, it is a paradigm work, shift in thinking, and
it should contain a terminology section. The practice of the author will
be to list existing words, and include their meanings. For technical
jargons, the author will rely on the Internet, as a definition resource.
If the author is introducing a new word, the author will explain its
meaning, but this is rare.

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
:   The web uses the HTTP network protocol; there is a limit to how many
    requests that a particular host, may handle simultaneously.

<!-- -->

HTTP Client (or Web Browser)
:   There is partiality of the author towards Mozilla\'s Firefox,
    because Mozilla is a non-profit organization, committed to web
    standards, and it was closely associated with Brendan Eich, the
    creator of JavaScript, the software is open source, and its gives us
    the opportunity to test our Microsoft implemented software in a
    non-proprietary, vendor neutral environment. For compatibility with
    standard, the author performs tests on Microsoft\'s Internet
    Explorer (MSIE), Google\'s Chrome, mobile telephones emulators and
    simulation.

<!-- -->

HTTP Server
:   The author use Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), the
    author has experience with both the Apache HTTP Server, Apache
    Tomcat Server. The author preference for IIS, includes its tight
    integration to the Windows Operating System, SQL Server and .net
    framework.

<!-- -->

Latency
:   This is the amount of time, it takes to respond to request. The use
    of AJAX, helps to decrease the duration, the length of time, it
    takes to load-up a page.

<!-- -->

Linking
:   This dissertation depends on the structural navigation links for the
    table of contents. The associative links help to drill-down to
    particular scripture reference and Bible words. The author also
    lists, outbound links, re-direct to source web references, as in the
    bibliography section. Registration with search engines is one of the
    ways to encourage incoming links.

[Machine Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html)
:   A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect
    to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its
    performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with
    experience E (Goodfellow et al. 2016). Machine Learning takes as
    input: data and answers and derives rules (Bileschi et al. 2020).

### Database Modeling {#DatabaseModeling datetime="2023-06-29T16:43:00"}

#### Entity-Relationship (ER) Model {#EntityRelationshipModel datetime="2023-06-29T16:48:00"}

##### Entities {#EntityRelationshipModel_Entities datetime="2023-06-29T16:49:00"}

A relational database identifies an entity as a table. In
object-oriented programming, an entity is referred to as a class. The
author\'s specific work is in the HisWord, ActToGod, Remember, APass
tables. The scripture table serves as input for scripture reference,
Bible word search, and gauge for AlphabetSequence.

##### Attributes {#EntityRelationshipModel_Attributes datetime="2023-06-29T17:13:00"}

The Holy Spirit informed the Word.

##### Identifiers {#EntityRelationshipModel_Identifiers datetime="2023-06-29T17:27:00"}

Previously, the author thought of the word as unique.

##### Relationships {#EntityRelationshipModel_Relationships datetime="2023-06-29T17:37:00"}

In most cases, surrogate keys such as ContactID, HisWordID are pointers
to associations.

###### Degree-Two Relationships {#EntityRelationshipModel_DegreeTwoRelationships datetime="2023-06-29T18:38:00"}

Normalization results in a master Contact table with multiple details.
There is a one-to-many (1:N) relationship.

##### Cardinality {#EntityRelationshipModel_Cardinality datetime="2023-06-29T19:04:00"}

###### Maximum cardinality {#EntityRelationshipModel_MaximumCardinality datetime="2023-06-29T19:08:00"}

This is the largest number of possible occurrences on one side of a
relationship. There can be only one contact for each contact detail.

###### Minimum cardinality {#EntityRelationshipModel_MinimumCardinality datetime="2023-06-29T19:18:00"}

There may be no contact details for a contact.

##### Strength of Entity {#EntityRelationshipModel_StrengthOfEntity datetime="2023-06-29T19:33:00"}

The contact entity is strong because it can exist on its own. The weak
contact details are existence-dependent on the contact entity.

###### ID-dependent entities {#EntityRelationshipModel_IDDependentEntities datetime="2023-06-29T19:43:00"}

The weak contact details, primary keys include their ContactID.

  -------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Accessor Pattern           Get and set an attribute by using a property.                                                                                                     The boundary to a property value. Readonly is achievable by disabling the set method.                                                                                    
  Delegation Pattern         Composition substitutes for inheritance.                                                                                                          The author does not inherit any class. But the author delegates by using composition to include existing services.                                                       [BibleBook.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/main/InformationInTransit/ProcessLogic/BibleBook.cs)
  Factory Pattern            Create subclasses from one or more methods.                                                                                                       At runtime, instantiate a variable object.                                                                                                                               [BallFactory.java](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/main/Java/DougLowe/JavaAll-In-OneForDummies/BallFactory.java)
  Immutable Pattern          An immutable object is unchangeable after creation.                                                                                               A string object is immutable. Although behind the scenes a string object is a reference type, it is treatable like a value type. A StringBuilder object is changeable.   
  Marker interface Pattern   The marker interface pattern is empty. It is metadata that refers to additional work. Examples in Java include Cloneable, Remote, Serializable.   A class may implement the cloneable interface to identify support for the clone method, which may perform shallow or deep copy.                                          [BibleBook.java](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/main/Java/DougLowe/JavaAll-In-OneForDummies/BibleBook.java)
  Singleton Pattern          Only a single instance is createable.                                                                                                             At Daigaku Honyaku Center (DHC) there was a database table which is a reference and contains a single record.

### Data quality management {#DataQualityManagement datetime="2023-04-01T18:07:00"}

-   Data quality standards: The author is importing religious data from
    trusted sources. The author is following rigorous practice.
-   Data quality assessment: The author is reducing human error by
    automating labor. Once a process is understood, the author
    computerizes the work.
-   Data quality monitoring: The work has been on-going for at least the
    last 20 years; therefore, there is awareness of the expected
    results.
-   Data quality reporting: There have been spurious cases of data loss,
    referential integrity violation, corrupt databases, computer
    breakdown and hard disk not recoverable.
-   Data quality issue management: Having data facing the Internet is a
    risk, so there is password protection, no web access, little
    metadata.
-   Data quality improvement: The author educates about data safety.

### Data observability {#DataObservability datetime="2023-04-02T13:32:00"}

-   Data pipeline tracking: Microsoft SQL Server offers overwhelming
    statistics. There is information on the duration of backup, restore
    and other tasks in its maintenance plan, profiler, query plan, logs.
-   Data quality assessment: Microsoft .NET limits the timeout between
    request and response. Data growth is manageable by size or
    percentage. Schema changes are done via Transact-SQL, which
    propagates.

(Petr Travkin).
"[]{cite="#bibliographyObjectManagementGroup®(OMG®)UnifiedModelingLanguage(UML)"}"

### Unified Modeling Language (UML) {#UnifiedModelingLanguage(UML) datetime="2023-03-11T13:13:00"}

(Unified Modeling Language)

#### Common Structure {#UnifiedModelingLanguage(UML)CommonStructure datetime="2023-03-11T13:13:00"}

UML composes elements and relationships as in its predecessor
Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams.

A model contains elements which may have descendants for
specializations. A contact may have children such as addresses. When a
contact is removed, this cascades to the removal of its children.

Comments do not impact programatically, they only serve as guides for
readers.

A directed relationship may exist between a collection of source and
target.

A namespace is a container separator.

An import facilitates the admittance of an external namespace.

Types and multiplicity restrict the units of information. For example, a
scripture reference can only identify book titles, chapters and verses.
For the King James Version of the Bible, the cardinality of the books is
66.

A constraint represents the range of valid values that a member may
have.

A dependency replicates changes between the supplier/client.

#### Value {#UnifiedModelingLanguage(UML)Value datetime="2023-03-11T16:15:00"}

Lack of a value is null. A data type may place its own degree of
significance on a value. For example integer versus (VS) decimal, date
versus (VS) datetime.

A string is a combination of alphabets, numbers and symbols. For
example, as in scripture reference, when it may concatenate Bible book
titles, chapters, verses, and separators.

An integer is a whole number. For example, BibleReference which consists
of Book ID, chapter and verse.

A Boolean is either true or false and it is normally used for
validation.

A real is a number with decimal relevance, such as ratios and
percentages.

#### Classification {#UnifiedModelingLanguage(UML)Classification datetime="2023-03-13T21:16:00"}

This work is largely based on migrating from free-text to relational
data. Classification serves well with scripture reference pre and post,
and book titles, chapters and verses. The C# language class
instantiations occur in
[ScriptureReferenceHelper.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/main/InformationInTransit/ProcessLogic/ScriptureReferenceHelper.cs){target="_blank"}
[Exact.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/main/InformationInTransit/ProcessLogic/Exact.cs){target="_blank"}

The author\'s work has not featured inheritance. There are no
generalizations, parents, nor specializations, children, classes. A
substitution for this is an interface, such as, IScriptable
[UtilitySQLServerManagementObjectsSMO.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordOfGod2/blob/master/UtilitySQLServerManagementObjectsSMO.cs){target="_blank"}
A child may override a parent\'s virtual member.

In the C# language, an abstract class is static, not instantiable. A
static class may contain extension methods.

Signals and receptions are similar to events and handlers. A page load
or close is an asynchronous signal that its subscribers handle
separately. A click event is triggered and resolved internally.

Microsoft .Net supports components such as a pre-compiled dynamic link
library (.dll), and compiling web forms and web services at first
request. Web form matured from code-behind to code-beside.

For the Java language, there must be a correlation between package and
directory names. Microsoft .Net does not impose such consistency. [ But
the author abides by this rule. ]{datetime="2023-03-16T12:42:00"
scripturereference="Daniel 9:24-27"}

In C# version 9, a method may offer a covariant return type.

The SQL script contains four scripture references; therefore, there are
four execution plans. Three of these execution plans, Query 1, 3 and 4,
will solely make use of the low cost clustered index primary key seek,
PK_Scripture. These three have trivial optimization levels.

Query 2 does an Index Seek on the IDX_Scripture_VerseIDSequence, since
the where clause is on the VerseIDSequence column. The
IDX_Scripture_VerseIDSequence indexes on the VerseIDSequence column; it
is not a covering index, since the Select column-list includes the
BookID, ChapterID, VerseID; therefore, the PK_Scripture is referenced as
well in a Key Lookup. Both the Index Seek and the Key Lookup have Seek
Predicates, and the Nested Loops will join the results.

days (1963 biblical years, 8 biblical months, 15 days).

Between the end of the 70th week, if there had been no interruption,
0039-03-01, and 1967-10-15, are 704415 days (1956 biblical years, 8
biblical months, 15 days).

Between 1967-10-15 and 2020-06-03 are 19225 days (53 biblical years, 4
biblical months, 25 days) (52 years, 7 months, 2 weeks, 5 days).

The Yoruba tribe speak the Yoruba language and the Yorubas are in the
South West of Nigeria. The Yorubas practice the Christians and Moslems
religions. The East of Nigeria include the Ibos who speak the Igbo
language and are mainly Catholics. The Hausas and Fulanis are in the
North of Nigeria. At the Highway 880 South Fremont Exit, the road
separates into two, the Alvarado Boulevard, West direction, and Fremont
Boulevard, East direction.

The author\'s primary languages are English, a
[Germanic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages) language;
and [Yoruba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language), a language
spoken by western Nigerians. Between the age of twenty and twenty-four,
the author developed Kowe, a word and graphic processor. Kowe is an
editor, for typing; Kowe\'s innovation, is that the typist can type
[diacritic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic) alphabets by using
the function keys combined with the alternate, control, and shift keys.
Line drawing is also possible with Kowe. Kowe will translate languages.

Between 1997 - 1998, the author pursued his Doctorate at the University
of Wollongong, New South Wales (NSW), Australia; and he visited
Villawood Detention Center, a place for illegal migrants and asylum
seekers, every Friday, as a Christian missionary. One of those migrants,
a Ghanaian, had been at the detention center for up-to six years, and he
corresponded with immigration officials, regularly. The author thought
of building a website that will allow these migrants to share their
experiences with the rest of the world. However, the Internet, was still
in its infancy, and the author\'s knowledge was lacking. Also there were
only dial-up access, at that time; and the inmates at Villawood, did not
have computer access.

Like Jacob, the author\'s biological father is the second born, and the
author is the second twin. [Option B: Facing Adversity, Building
Resilience, and Finding Joy](http://www.optionb.org/book). I lived in
Australia, Down Under, which is in the Asia-Pacific geographical region,
for seven years; we can see a demarcation, West and East Germany, North
and South Italy. Tokunbo is the author\'s biological father\'s fourth
child, and she gave birth to twins.

Innocents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents).
