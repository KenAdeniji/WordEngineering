## Abstract {#Abstract}

**Thesis Statement:** This dissertation introduces
[AlphabetSequence](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html)
( [2 Corinthians
10:9-18](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=2%20Corinthians%2010:9-18){dated="2022-01-07T09:08:00"
word="That create." hiswordid="144962" contactid="11433"} ). The
[AlphabetSequenceIndex]{.dfn dated="2025-05-20T20:34:00"} is the [result
of a pure function to sum alphabet places]{dated="2020-09-09T00:00:00"}
[AlphabetSequence.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/InformationInTransit/ProcessLogic/AlphabetSequence.cs)
. [ The [AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference]{.dfn
dated="2025-05-20T20:24:00"} are the offsets from the beginning and the
ending of the Scripture. ]{dated="2020-09-14T00:00:00"} [ The
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference consists of four parts; there
are two references each to particular chapters and verses. The first
mention is the forward verse, which the author calculates by determining
the AlphabetSequenceIndex verse in the Bible. The second mention is the
forward chapter, and this the author calculates as before, but by
substituting the verse with the chapter. Both the backward chapter and
backward verse are the corresponding, anticlockwise places.

The issuing of this domain name may be related to commencing writing the
book titled Ocean Senior on 2004-03-23. There has not been a follow-up
on future artifacts. But when one reads the Bible, the book of
Revelation, which starts with the letters to the 7 churches in Asia
Minor, does not instigate future alteration.

### The Bible Database {#BibleDatabase}

#### The Scripture Table {#ScriptureTable}

<div>

The content of the Bible SQL Server database is principally the
Scripture table. The Scripture table has a [composite primary
key](http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/jeffs/archive/2007/08/23/composite_primary_keys.aspx)
, which consists of three columns; the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID
columns. The SQL statement

    ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Scripture PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
    (
        BookID ASC,
        ChapterID ASC,
        VerseID ASC
    )

is for setting the primary key.

</div>

There are varchar(MAX) columns which has the text for each Bible
version.

##### The Scripture Table\'s BookID Column {#ScriptureTableBookIDColumn}

<div>

Because there are sixty-six books in the Bible, the BookID ranges
between 1 and 66; starting from Genesis and ending at Revelation. The
SQL statement

    ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Scripture_BookID_Range CHECK (BookID BETWEEN 1 AND 66)

will set the range restriction.

</div>

##### The Scripture Table\'s ChapterID Column {#ScriptureTableChapterIDColumn}

<div>

The ChapterID ranges between 1 and 150; the SQL statement

    SELECT MAX(ChapterID) FROM Bible..Scripture

is for determining the upper limit. The SQL statement

    ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture WITH CHECK ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Scripture_ChapterID_Range CHECK  (([ChapterID]>=(1) AND [ChapterID]<=(150)))

will set the range restriction.

</div>

##### The Scripture Table\'s VerseID Column {#ScriptureTableVerseIDColumn}

<div>

The VerseID ranges between 1 and 176; the SQL statement

    SELECT MAX(VerseID) FROM Bible..Scripture

is for determining the upper limit. The SQL statement

    ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture WITH CHECK ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Scripture_VerseID_Range CHECK  (([VerseID]>=(1) AND [VerseID]<=(176)))

will set the range restriction.

</div>

##### The Scripture Table\'s KingJamesVersion Column {#ScriptureTableKingJamesVersionColumn}

The author would have considered placing an index on the
KingJamesVersion column, but the author found out during his research
that the verses in the KingJamesVersion are not unique nor distinct, and
indexes are not applicable to where like query conditions with leading
wildcards.

##### The Scripture View\'s Testament Column {#Scripture_ViewTestamentColumn}

<div>

The SQL statement

    (case when BookID <=(39) then 'Old' else 'New' end)

will set this computed column. The Testament column serves as a filter,
such as, in the
[BibleWord.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html).

</div>

##### The Scripture View\'s BookTitle Column {#Scripture_ViewBookTitleColumn}

<div>

The SQL statement

    dbo.udf_BookTitle(BookID)

It is for determining this computed column. As expected, there is a
correlation between the BookID column, and its corresponding BookTitle
column; it progresses from Genesis to Revelation. Because SQL does not
support arrays, the author chose to write an [SQL
CLR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_CLR) C# function for determining
the BookTitle when passed the BookID. Although C# supports [Design by
contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) assertions,
the author only checks BookID range validity, and returns NULL, if the
argument does not fall within this range. The author could throw
exceptions, but the author does not know the side effects nor the full
ramifications. Instead of writing and determining the book title using
C#, an alternative is to use a database table. A table with two columns,
BookID and BookTitle, will store and make
[extractable]{dated="2021-03-17T19:11:00"} the sixty-six books. [ For
example, the first book of the New Testament, the 40th book, spelling is
Matthew or Mathew, double tt versus (VS) single t. An improvement on the
current implementation is to use soundex to 2026-01-22T10:12:00 index
the book title and determine the corresponding BookID.
]{dated="2020-10-06T15:05:00"}

</div>

##### The Scripture Table\'s ScriptureReference Column {#ScriptureTableScriptureReferenceColumn}

<div>

The SQL statement

    dbo.udf_ScriptureReference(BookID, ChapterID, VerseID)

Will calculate the conjecture of the BookTitle, ChapterID, and VerseID.
Since this is a computed column, therefore, the author is not able to
set its [Entity
Integrity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_integrity); if it were
not the SQL statement

    ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT uc_Scripture_ScriptureReference UNIQUE (ScriptureReference)

Will set its entity integrity. The distinction between raw data versus
computed columns is performance and space.

</div>

##### The Scripture Table\'s ChapterIDSequence Column {#ScriptureTableChapterIDSequenceColumn}

<div>

When loading data, the author decides the ChapterIDSequence column, and
increments it when the BookID and ChapterID, change during loading. The
ChapterIDSequence ranges between 1 and 1189, starting in Genesis 1 and
ending at Revelation 22. The SQL statement

    SELECT BookID, ChapterID FROM Bible..Scripture GROUP BY BookID, ChapterID ORDER BY BookID, ChapterID

will decide the greatest value for ChapterIDSequence. An alternative SQL
statement

    select count(
    distinct
        cast(BookID as varchar(6))
        + ' '
        + cast(ChapterID as varchar(6))
    )
    FROM    Bible..Scripture

Another SQL statement

    ; with cte
    (
          BookID
        , ChapterID
    )
    as
    (
        select distinct BookID, ChapterID
        FROM    Bible..Scripture
    )
    select cnt = count(*)
    from   cte

The SQL statement

    ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Scripture_ChapterIDSequence_Range CHECK (ChapterIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 1189)

will check the range correctness. Although it is good to know the
ChapterIDSequence, but it is primarily used to decide the boundaries for
scripture reference queries.

</div>

##### The Scripture Table\'s VerseIDSequence Column {#ScriptureTableVerseIDSequenceColumn}

<div>

When loading data, the author calculates the VerseIDSequence column, and
increments it, every time, the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID changes
during the data load. There are some Bible books that have only one
chapter, such as, Obadiah, Philemon, 2 John, 3 John, Jude; therefore,
the author is careful when the choice is made to increment and update
the VerseIDSequence column. The SQL statement

    SELECT BookTitle FROM Bible..Scripture GROUP BY BookID, BookTitle HAVING MAX(ChapterID) = 1 ORDER BY BookID

is for listing these one chapter, Bible books. The VerseIDSequence
ranges between 1 and 31102; starting from Genesis 1:1, and ending at
Revelation 22:21. The SQL statement

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Bible..Scripture

will decide the greatest value for VerseIDSequence, the total number of
rows, records, in the Bible..Scripture table. The SQL statement

    ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT  CK_Scripture_VerseIDSequence_Range CHECK (VerseIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 31102)

will do the data integrity. As said earlier, although it is good to know
the VerseIDSequence, but it is primarily used to decide the boundaries
for scripture reference queries. The identity functionality which
auto-increments, before inserting each row is useful, for ensuring this
candidate primary key, abides by the entity integrity constraint;
however, The SQL statement

    ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture
    ADD CONSTRAINT AK_Scripture_VerseIDSequence UNIQUE (VerseIDSequence)   

is supplementary.

</div>

##### The Scripture_View BibleReference Column {#ScriptureTableBibleReferenceColumn}

<div>

The SQL statement

    ((right('00'+CONVERT([varchar](2),[BookID],(0)),(2))+right('000'+CONVERT([varchar](3),[ChapterID],(0)),(3)))+right('000'+CONVERT([varchar](3),[VerseID],(0)),(3)))

will combine the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID. This is a convention
for referring to Bible rows, by a unique identifier, which consists of
the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID. The leading zeros are placeholders
for blocks of IDs, such as, BookID which will have two digits, ChapterID
which will have three digits, and VerseID which will also have three
digits. It is easier, faster, and more compact to restrict and order by
numbers rather than text. Listed below, is the result set, for this SQL
statement.

    SELECT ScriptureReference, BibleReference
    FROM Bible..Scripture_View
    WHERE BookID = 43 AND ChapterID = 1 AND VerseID = 1

</div>

  ScriptureReference   BibleReference

Please note, that the author has not developed this further, it is just
an introduction and speculation, which others may wish to adopt.

Most of the applications, extract information, and query the Scripture
table. If the user chooses to, he may choose to load another Bible
version, into the Scripture table and the application will still work as
usual, and there will be no need to make changes to the application;
thereby, achieving 0 [Separation of concerns
(SoC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns).

#### The Exact Table {#ExactTable}

The
[Exact](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/Exact.html?bibleWord=KAA)
table\'s, primary task, is to tell, on the words that are in the Bible.
Its information set include each word\'s first and last scripture
reference occurrence(s), and count of occurrence(s). If the word, occurs
only once, then the last occurrence is set to null. The incentive for
writing the exact module comes from [Dave
Hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Hunt_%28Christian_apologist%29),
who will talk of each word\'s specifics, and [Chuck
Missler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Missler) who noted that the
first occurrence of the word,
[love](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=Love&wholeWords=false)
is in [Genesis
22:2](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2022:2).
The exact table, is a holding area, for staging information; it could be
argued that there is no need, to have this table, because it sources its
information from the Scripture table, and it is available using
[Language Integrated
Query](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query). The
reasoning of the author is that the Scripture table is static data, and
it does not need processing, each time, there is a request. Speed and
lower work load are the advantages of the approach of the author; its
disadvantage is that the exact table needs re-population, when there is
a shift to another Bible version, which the author does not project, at
this time. If there is a need, to support another Bible version, then
the Exact table loading procedure needs expansion to aid, this
flexibility. The
[Exact](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/Exact.html?bibleWord=KAA)
result for the author\'s initials, KAA, is Karkaa, meaning
[floor](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/bibledictionary.html?bibleWord=Karkaa)
([Joshua
15:3](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Joshua%2015:3)).
[Word
Occurrences](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordGroup/WordOccurrences.html?bibleWord=Christ)
is dynamic, and it supports the other versions of the Bible.

##### The Exact Table\'s ExactID Column {#ExactTableExactIDColumn}

<div>

The ExactID is an [identity
column](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_column), meaning the
database, SQL Server, auto-increments its value, before insertion. There
are 12891 unique words, in the Bible..Exact table. The SQL statement

    SELECT MAX(ExactID) FROM Bible..Exact

is for determining the highest value. The SQL statement

    SELECT COUNT(BibleWord) FROM Bible..Exact

is for determining the word count. The SQL statement

    ALTER TABLE Bible..Exact ADD CONSTRAINT  CK_Exact_ExactID_Range CHECK (ExactID BETWEEN 1 AND 12891)

is for the range restriction. For storage reason, the author has chosen,
not to have a unique index, on this candidate primary key; in-spite, of
it being a query item. Future implementation, may issue the SQL
statement

    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX AK_Exact_ExactID ON Bible..Exact(ExactID)

``` {dated="2020-12-14T16:51:00"}
SELECT SUM(FrequencyOfOccurrence) FROM Bible..Exact
```

is 789631; this is the count of the words in the KJV Bible.

</div>

##### The Exact Table\'s BibleWord Column {#ExactTableBibleWordColumn}

<div>

These are the words that occur in the Bible, in the order of their
occurrences. The author sets the [primary
key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_key), the constraint, by
issuing the SQL statement

    ALTER TABLE dbo.Exact ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Exact PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (BibleWord ASC)

</div>

##### The Exact Table\'s FirstOccurrenceScriptureReference Column {#ExactTableFirstOccurrenceScriptureReferenceColumn}

<div>

This is the scripture reference where the word first occurs in the
Bible. The author may set-up the relationship by issuing the SQL
statement

    ALTER TABLE dbo.Exact WITH CHECK ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Exact_Scripture
    FOREIGN KEY(FirstOccurrenceScriptureReference)
    REFERENCES dbo.Scripture (ScriptureReference)

Please note, that as discussed earlier, the author cannot have, a unique
constraint, on the Bible..Scripture.ScriptureReference column, since
this is a computed column; the author can not keep up the relationship,
at this time.

</div>

##### The Exact Table\'s LastOccurrenceScriptureReference Column {#ExactTableLastOccurrenceScriptureReferenceColumn}

This is the reference to the scripture where the word last occurs in the
Bible; if there is only one occurrence, the value of this entry is null.
As with the FirstOccurrence column, the referential integrity rule
applies.

##### The Exact Table\'s Difference Column {#ExactTableDifferenceColumn}

This is to measure the word\'s longevity; the difference in
VerseIDSequence between when it first and last appeared.

##### The Exact Table\'s Occurrence Column {#Occurrence}

This is the pervasiveness of the word, how often is the word used in the
Bible?

### The WordEngineering Database {#WordEngineeringDatabase}

The WordEngineering SQL Server database, mainly consists, of four
tables - [HisWord](#HisWord), [Remember](#Remember), [APass](#APass),
[ActToGod](#ActToGod).

#### The HisWord Table {#HisWord}

The HisWord table is what the author heard from the source. The entries
in the HisWord table are exact and representable in alphanumeric format
([Numbers
12:6-8](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Numbers%2012:6-8)).
In following, the Bible\'s New Testament convention, where there are
translations of Hebrew words to English [which is being
interpreted](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=which%20is%20being%20interpreted),
([Matthew 1:23, Mark 5:41, Mark 15:22, Mark 15:34, John 1:38, John 1:41,
Acts
4:36](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%201:23,%20Mark%205:41,%20Mark%2015:22,%20Mark%2015:34,%20John%201:38,%20John%201:41,%20Acts%20:36,%201%20Corinthians%2014:28));
so also, there are translations of Yoruba words to English.

There have been cases when the author cannot spell and fully comprehend
what he heard. In such cases, and not dispose of the records, the author
will partly enter what he heard. This impedance mismatch between what
the speaker said and what the listener heard, rarely occurs with English
words. But it is likely, in the author\'s native language, Yoruba, which
exploits word combinations and phrases. The alphabets differ slightly
between the English and Yoruba languages; Yoruba contains diacritic
alphabets. The author requires a Yoruba dictionary and translator; a

The HisWord table\'s most important column, as the name suggests, is the
word column, which is either English or Yoruba; or a mixture of both
languages. The author will yield to the Holy Spirit in translating
Yoruba words to English. From previous experience, this translation is
not always the most right or relevant, and different words may contain
the diacritic alphabets; therefore, introduce various meanings ([1
Corinthians 12:30, 1 Corinthians
14](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=1%20Corinthians%2012:30,%201%20Corinthians%2014)).
To account for the discrepancy in translation, the author sought help
from the LORD:

1.  2015-11-02T22:55:00 [And, the merge, is the money,
    convert.](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=And,%20the%20merge,%20is%20the%20money,%20convert.){dated="2015-11-02T22:55:00"
    hiswordid="78834" contactid="9229"}
2.  2015-11-03T02:17:00 [The specifics, a
    language.](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=The%20specifics,%20a%20language.){dated="2015-11-03T02:17:00"
    hiswordid="78829" contactid="9230"}

</div>

The word column is a potential natural primary key, since duplicates are
rare. When redundancies do occur, we may append the sequence to the
word, to generate a unique word. We do this manually, but an [insert
trigger](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/plsql/plsql_triggers.htm), will
offer automation, and will cut the risk of primary key violation, which
leads to gaps in the identity column [and, loss of
data.](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=and,%20loss%20of%20data.){dated="2025-03-18T18:08:00"
hiswordid="165614" contactid="15889"
url="npr.org/2025/03/18/g-s1-54493/judge-boasberg-trump-deportation-flights?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us"
commentary="2025-03-18T18:08:00 urine."}

The HisWord\'s table, commentary column, contains implicit information.
This communication is most likely non-verbal, and it is information such
as creatures standing or moving towards particular locations or engaging
in other visible activities.

As such, from the creation account, on the first day, there is a
commandment, and there may be an action/response. The commandment is in
the word column God created light ( [Genesis 1:3,
5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%201:3,%205)
). The action is in the commentary column; God separated the light from
the darkness ([Genesis 1:1-2,
4](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%201:1-2,%204)).

Microsoft SQL Server generates sequential numbers for the HisWordID
[identity column](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_column). The
goodness of this technique is that it is a candidate primary key, data
loss is trackable, and it provides a sort key. The HisWordID column may
serve as the [primary](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_primarykey.asp)
and/or [foreign key](http://www.1keydata.com/sql/sql-foreign-key.html),
the backbone of the [Referential Integrity
Constraint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity).

The Dated column is of the DateTime type. If an insert statement does
not explicitly specify a value for the dated column, then it defaults to
the current date and time of the [(UTC-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)
time zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone). There is a
preference for the [Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) format.

A relational constraint limit to a single foreign key? The author will
choose either the most vivid or rare?

#### HisWord_view {#Hisword_view}

The HisWord_view composes of the computed columns deducted from
analyzing the Word. The two most significant computations are the
AlphabetSequenceIndex, and the reliant
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference, respectively. The author
derives the AlphabetSequenceIndex from the word by adding the place of
the alphabets in the alphabet set. In the ASCII table, the lower case
alphabets are between 97 and 122, and the upper case alphabets are
between 65 and 90. The lower and upper case alphabets have the same
places. The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference is the books,
chapters, verses separation in the scripture. The author will consider
the chapter and verse place, forward and backward. Use the
[AlphabetSequence.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequence.html)
to calculate the computed values identified above. The AlphabetSequence
is like [Gematria, Mispar Hechrachi
method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria). [Titles of
God](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordGroup/AndThePriestSaidAreOneOnlyForMe.html).

#### The Remember Table {#Remember}

The Remember table tries to correlate the period between a prophecy and
its fulfillment. "[The [terminus a
quo](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/terminus_a_quo) DatedFrom is when the
prophecy begins, and it marks the the date of issue or establishing of
the prophecy. The [terminus ad
quem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_post_quem) DatedUntil is
when a prophecy partially or entirely comes to
pass.]{cite="#bibliographyKoinoniaHouse"}" (Koinonia House).
[DateDifference.aspx](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/DateDifference.aspx)
is for calculating the difference between terminus a quo, versus
terminus ad quem; the results are in days; biblical years, months, days;
the Common Era. The inspiration for adding the Common Era comes from
[wikipedia.org](http://www.wikipedia.org) by Jimmy Wales.

To determine the HisWord and Remember entries? The author chooses to
separate the particular and prompted inputs ( [Luke
4:19](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%204:19)
).

#### APass {#APass dated="2020-12-14T17:02:00"}

First, inside and last dates.

#### ActToGod {#ActToGod dated="2020-12-14T17:03:00"}

This is subjective work; the author applys intelligence to find patterns
and resemblances in the Bible.

> -   Query optimization: Server-side database processing offers the
>     best performance scenario. The use of stored procedures and
>     functions is recommended. [The hold backs are their deployments
>     and SQL variances.]{dated="2024-01-29T23:26:00"} Prepared
>     statements are fast, resource lenient, cached, and they prevent
>     SQL injection attacks. The author falls back on dynamic SQL for
>     complex queries.
> -   Indexing: The author is well aware of the pros of indexing, but
>     its cons include additional space and effort. [The less performant
>     productive database objects are keys and
>     constraints.]{dated="2024-01-30T08:23:00"}
> -   Data Modeling: Normalization
>     1.  First Normal Form (1NF): A relation meets this rule when each
>         attribute has only one value. Another condition is that all
>         the attribute values are atomic and non-composite. In the
>         HisWord table there may be multiple contacts, but only the
>         most prominent contact is recorded. A contact must be first
>         created in the Contact table, prior to its referencing, to
>         satisfy its referential integrity constraint. The author does
>         abide with 1NF in the HisWord table. The URI column may
>         contain multiple e-mail addresses. The scripture reference
>         column may not be a unit.
>     2.  Second Normal Form (2NF): The ActToGod table does not comply
>         with this rule, since its Minor column is functionally
>         dependent on its Major column. [Computed columns minimize the

### Database Scaling {#DatabaseScaling dated="2023-02-13T18:31:00"}

-   The transition to computed columns results in smaller storage
    requirements.
-   Microsoft SQL Server supports multiple databases; therefore,
    reducing archive needs.
-   Normalization, object-to-relational mapping, is light load.

### Database Exclusivity {#DatabaseExclusivity dated="2023-02-10T15:17:00"}

#### Row Limit {#RowLimit dated="2023-12-03T15:59:00"}

#### Where Clause {#WhereClause dated="2023-02-10T15:19:00"}

  Title                                                    Commentary

  Table join superceeds the previous column key equal to   FROM table join primary and foreign key

#### Select Clause {#SelectClause dated="2023-02-10T15:53:00"}

The select clause may explictly include a column list. Pre-compiled
statements that implictly cater for all the source columns, may not be
up-to-date on the column-list.

#### Group By Clause {#GroupByClause dated="2023-02-10T16:13:00"}

The group by statement is not for detail listing, except when it is used
to regress to the distinct clause. Group by supports statistics, such
as, count, sum, min, max, avg.

#### Having By Clause {#HavingByClause dated="2023-02-10T16:19:00"}

The having clause augments the group by clause. It places restriction on
the group(s) returned.

#### Insert Statement {#InsertStatement dated="2023-02-10T16:23:00"}

Inserts give room to omit the default columns. The Identity Insert
statement also grants explicit entry of its identity column.

#### Nullable Column {#NullableColumn dated="2023-02-10T16:30:00"}

Information unknown is useful for forwarding processing, until and if
the information is added. Outer Join stands for this purpose.

#### View {#View dated="2023-02-10T16:38:00"}

Enhances tables by compacting and/or extending the information set.

#### Constraint {#Constraint dated="2023-02-10T20:23:00"}

Primary and foreign keys, unique indexes and check constraints.

### Data Cleansing {#DataCleansing dated="2022-08-19T11:00:00"}

-   Is the source of bad data input internal, on-line users, or error in
    programming? [He doesn\'t envision error in reference
    data.]{dated="2022-08-23T17:22:00"}
-   Does the vendor have data definition language (DDL) to pre-empt data
    corruption?
    -   Data type and size: String, number, date, logic boolean?
    -   Not nullable? Can not be empty?
    -   Range check: Expense must be greater than zero? Dates of
        activities must be after the establishment creation date.
    -   Check constraints, for schedule, dated from must precede dated
        until.
    -   Non-surrogate primary and foreign keys with unique indexes help
        to ascertain data.
    -   Default columns are probable system generated that the users may
        leave unfilled that are available from sequence, identity,
        system clock.
-   Is the data incomplete, such as abbreviation, for example CA or
    California, telephone numbers without country or area code?
-   Is it data manipulation language (DML) deadlock, arrangement of data
    modification? [Transaction commit or rollback?
    Cascade?]{dated="2022-08-23T17:15:00"}
-   Duplicate entries are isolatable by using the group by clause.

### The author prescribes the steps below to begin database set-up and usage {#the-author-prescribes-the-steps-below-to-begin-database-set-up-and-usage dated="2022-06-07T14:17:00"}

1.  Acquire a database management system (DBMS). Various varieties of
    DBMS are available. The user may download a DBMS, get a compact
    disc, or select from the cloud.
2.  Install a DBMS.
3.  Decide on a user interface for managing the database. For Microsoft
    SQL Server, the choices include the SQLCmd console utility or the
    SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio.
4.  Create database. Microsoft SQL Server supports multiple instances
    and databases.
5.  The data definition language (DDL) includes the commands to create,
    alter, or delete tables, views, primary and foreign keys, indexes,
    constraints and defaults.
6.  The data manipulation language (DML) are commands to insert, update,
    and delete the database rows and columns, with the option to use the
    where clause.
7.  The SQL Server maintenance plan is for database housekeeping, for
    example, backup, restore, and re-arrangement.
8.  Stored-procedures, triggers, and functions are programmable logic.

>   Front-End Browser         HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Javascript, Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)   The front-end code may run on a desktop, laptop, or mobile telephone that offers a user interface (UI). The task is to accept the user query and to display the result. Initially, as a novice programmer, the author wrote specific code for each user request; later, the author rests on generic code which will handle multiple variety of requests. This is high-level programming, and the skill-set entry level is minimal. The author also believes that the users should not require any formal training to use his work. Customization is achievable by varying the request options, such as entry form selections, query arguments, or data attributes.
>   Middle-Tier Application   C#, Embedded-SQL                                                            For backward compatibility, the author does not envision moving away from his legacy code investment in Microsoft. The only shift is positioning code away from database inconsistencies in back-end residency. To code, compile, debug, deploy, the experience of the author is with Microsoft Visual Studio and command-line tools.
>   Server-Side Backend       Standard Query Language (SQL)                                               The author most recent experience is with the Sybase and Microsoft Transact-SQL assortment. Now a days, to be compatible and after experimentation; the author rarely uses Standard Query Language - Common Language Runtime (SQL-CLR). The author does database data entry, maintenance, development by using the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

>   : The Author Programs in the Following Tiers and Languages
>
> ### JavaScript Basics: Data Types {#javascript-basics-data-types dated="2021-12-05T03:44:00"}
>
> -   JavaScript supports three keywords for declaring variables. These
>     are the var, let, const keywords.
> -   From its pre-conception, JavaScript supported the var keyword.
>     When the author does not precede a variable initialization with a
>     keyword, then the variable will have global scope. The author
>     averts from variable hoisting. Variable definition with the var
>     keyword is re-usable. The strict mode is a later addition to
>     JavaScript that helps in enforcing variable rules.
> -   For one-time definitions, such as, issuing the
>     document.getElementById command, the author relies on the const
>     keyword.
> -   Unlike some typed languages, JavaScript does not support
>     explicitly specifying the type of a variable.
> -   JavaScript string comparisons are by default case-sensitive.
>
> ### Functions and Methods {#functions-and-methods dated="2021-12-05T17:51:00"}
>
> -   Methods are functions that are referrable from a class. Methods
>     support object orientation by offering encapsulation, inheritance,
>     polymorphism. The author uses functions when placing localizable
>     code inside the script section of a HTML file; otherwise,
>     generalized methods are referenceable from a JavaScript library.
> -   JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, and they are
>     passable as variables. This abstraction feature is rarely
>     necessary.
> -   JavaScript does not support method overloading. The earlier
>     arguments array variable and the later parameter default
>     initialization supplements.
> -   The author consistently uses anonymous functions for processing
>     the success and error returns when using jQuery to access web
>     services.
>
> ### Conditions {#conditions dated="2021-12-06T15:21:00"}
>
> -   The author emulates the Microsoft ASP.NET Page.IsPostBack property
>     check, and when it is not so, parse the query arguments;
>     otherwise, skip the parsing and proceed to page submittion.
>
> ### Arrays and Loops {#arrays-and-loops dated="2021-12-07T03:13:00"}
>
> -   For displaying the Bible book titles, the 66 books are in a
>     JavaScript iterable array. This reduces the data load from the
>     server to client, and it offers spelling flexibility. The select
>     options resemble similar customization.
>
> ### HyperText Markup Language (HTML) Document {#hypertext-markup-language-html-document dated="2021-12-07T11:37:00"}
>
> -   The DOCTYPE is the first declaration in an HTML document, and it
>     is the conformation standard specification.
> -   The html tag is the root and the container for all the other tags.
> -   The head tag contains the title and the meta tags for the search
>     engine optimization (SEO). The various documents will indicate the
>     cascading style sheet (CSS) directive.
> -   The body tag contains the visible content of the document. Its
>     resultSet or resultTable div will contain the particular details
>     that the program generates.

>
> #### What is data?
>
> The data that the author fundamentally operates on is the word from
> God. The initial and primary data is textual, but now the author
> places importance on dates and numbers.
>
> What should you do with a number? Even though the Hebrew language is
> AlphaNumeric, the numbers in the Bible are in words ( [Leviticus
> 19:26](/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Leviticus%2019:26){target="_blank"}
> ). When the author receives a number, he records it in the HisWord\'s
> table, Word column, as a numeral.
>
> 1.  The author extracts knowledge from data; by finding meaning to the
>     word.
> 2.  The author uses scientific methods, such as counting the number of
>     occurrences, determining the first and last occurrences, and
>     excluding the parts of speech.
> 3.  The actionable insights take, so far, is to computerize the work.
> 4.  The vast majority of the work is structured data. Unstructured
>     data does not fit into the background of the author.
> 5.  The application domain is Bible studies; how relevant is the Bible
>     to our work?
>
> #### Practicing Data Science {#practicing-data-science dated="2021-12-08T08:40:00"}
>
> 1.  Empirical, find implication from the Bible?
> 2.  Theoretical, to determine a better way to doing work?
> 3.  Computational, is human labor replaceable?
> 4.  Data-Driven, constraints help us to sanitize data. Default values

> #### What you can do with Data {#what-you-can-do-with-data dated="2021-12-08T09:55:00"}
>
> 1.  Data Acquisition: The Bible is available on the Microsoft Access

> 2.  Data Storage: The author imports this tabular data into the
>     Microsoft SQL Server relational database.
> 3.  Data Processing: The SQL Select statement is the means of

> ### Database and Application Server Source Files
>
> The author chose a multi-tier architecture for building the

> [Wikipedia](http://www.Wikipedia.com) mention these dates. The
> HisWord_view contains computed columns, which depend on entries in the
> HisWord table. The author extracts database information by building
> query statements.\
> The application layer is the bridge between the user interface layer
> and the database layer. The application layer compiles into a single
> [Dynamic-link
> library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library) (DLL),
> called InformationInTransit.dll. The application layer consists of
> four namespaces, namely, InformationInTransit.DataAccess,
> InformationInTransit.ProcessCode, InformationInTransit.ProcessLogic,
> InformationInTransit.UserInterface. What the author builds on the
> server; is accessible to all the clients. What is the lifetime of this
> code, and what neutrality does it condone? The author started out with
> [dBASE II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase). The lines of code for
> the application layer are in the C# and embedded SQL.

>
> The .HTML files will work in all browsers; that support AJAX. Most of
> the interactive web pages are reliant on JavaScript to work, mainly
> because they use Ajax to interact with the server. Each .HTML file,
> performs specific task, and may have a corresponding back-end
> associate, web service. The unobtrusive JavaScript file
> [9432.js](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/IIS/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.js)
> contains re-usable code that is not .HTML files specific. The .HTML
> files originally contained the .CSS specifications; however, the
> author now places styling information in a single external file,
> [9432.css](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/IIS/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.css).
> This will reduce the sizes of the .HTML files, and it helps to achieve
> a consistent user interface.
>
> The work of the author is interactive, and there are links to
> questions and answers pages. Most of the input entries are textual,
> but some are numeric, datetime, select options. The answers are mostly
> in tabular format.

(Vaibhav Verdhan).

> A HTML document contains:
>
> -   Text content: The author informs the reader by describing His
>     word.
> -   References to other files: The author refers to external files,
>     such as UML images.
> -   Markup:
>     -   Elements: The anchor tag is the most specific.
>     -   Attributes and Values: The author benefits from the

>     selector. The author does not use CSS Resets. The author issues
>     element selectors for the html, body, table and row.
> -   Layout Rules: There are no layout rules, such as header nor
>     footer.
> -   Module Rules: The table of content (TOC) is for page navigation
>     that the author offers using class names.
> -   State Rules: A state rule is for toggling, such as using
>     Javascript to set the visibility.

### Web Services

<div>

> There is standardization on the first .NET web services architecture,
> .ASMX.

(FrederikBulthoff, 2019) In most cases, there is a one-to-one mapping
between the .HTML, .ASMX, .CS files, and the database relational table,
Bible..Scripture. For simplicity and clearage of use, the .HTML and
.ASMX files, support one operation. GetAPage.html is the workhorse for
word utterances. GetAPage.html will send AJAX requests to multiple .ASMX
files and operations. GetAPage.html is a cumulation of separate .HTML
files. All the web services files support the SOAP request format and
return JSON. jQuery accepts the POST, HTTP verb. The author stringified
the data he passes to the web service in the body of the message. Errors
are unforeseen, in the rare case, the author logs errors on the
back-end, and display quantitative message. Security is lacking; this is
permissible; since the author only queries information.

</div>

The web service code, .asmx, file is not necessary, does not have a
place, when there is no server database access ( [Numbers 19:2, 2
Chronicles 15:3, John 15:25, Romans 2:12, Romans 3:21, Romans 3:28,
Romans 7:8, Romans 7:9, 1 Corinthians 9:21, Hebrews
9:22](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Numbers%2019:2,%202%20Chronicles%2015:3,%20John%2015:25,%20Romans%202:12,%20Romans%203:21,%20Romans%203:28,%20Romans%207:8,%20Romans%207:9,%201%20Corinthians%209:21,%20Hebrews%209:22)
).

The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) is available, for example,
by specifying the URI,
[AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL)
To generate a proxy code, issue the following command;
` wsdl.exe /language:CS /namespace:InformationInTransit.ProcessLogic /out:"AlphabetSequenceWebServiceProxy.cs" http://localhost/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL `
The Web Services Discovery Utility (disco) command:
` disco.exe "http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.disco" `
will generate the companion files; AlphabetSequenceWebService.disco,
AlphabetSequenceWebService.wsdl, and results.discomap

A lecture of our beginning. (Hafida Na ̈ım, 2016) The business rule is
storable and processable in C#, (.cs), source files. The dynamic link
library, (.dll), is callable from everywhere. GetAPage.html computes
AlphabetSequence from a simple logic, which is easily representable
everywhere. The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference is retrievable
from the Bible, using non-complex SQL query. The BibleWord and HisWord
reference, requires substantive query. The Bible dictionary returns
dataset from the local database. The author can not make a business
decision, to go to a web service, to retrieve what is locally
resideable.

### Database Size

The usp_DatabaseLogSize stored procedure is for determining the size of
the databases data files; and it is available at [T-SQL to find
Data,Log,Size and Other Useful information -SQL
2000/2005/2008/R2](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/T-SQL-to-find-DataLogSize-3564cfc0).

  : Database Size

> ### Database Standard
>
> #### Database Design
>
> 1.  The relational model is for storing information in tables.
> 2.  The author normalizes data using Object-relational mapping.
> 3.  All the databases are OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), not
>     OLAP (Online analytical processing).
> 4.  Avoid deadlock occurrences by not permitting user database
>     updates.
> 5.  All the transactions follow similar routes and sequences, and the
>     author practices granularity with the locks.
> 6.  Database updates are through stored procedures, which recognize
>     and avoid the potential of integrity violation.
>
> #### Database Security
>
> 1.  The secretive web.config file contains the database access
>     information.
> 2.  The web.config file does not explicitly mention the user login
>     name nor password.
> 3.  Give access rights to roles, not to specific login identities nor
>     user names.
>
> #### Database Data Types
>
> 1.  Choose matching data types between the database and application
>     layers.
> 2.  Only pick varchar(max) and nvarchar(max) as the data type, when it
>     is essential to store large data.
> 3.  Prefer the decimal type; when recording the amount in currency
>     rather than using the float type.
>
> #### Nullable Type
>
> 1.  Consider defaulting textual data to empty string; instead of NULL.
>
> #### Indexes
>
> 1.  Database changes lags with indexes.
> 2.  The field sequence in indexes should follow the frequency of
>     usage.
> 3.  When using a composite index, place a clustered non-unique index
>     on the major column.
>
> #### Naming Conventions
>
> 1.  Overall, consistency encourages lowercase keywords. Keywords in
>     lowercase are mandatory in case-sensitive programming languages
>     like C# and JavaScript, but not in SQL.
> 2.  Use Pascal casing for naming literals, such as, tables, columns,
>     stored procedures and functions.
> 3.  Use Camel casing for naming parameters and local variables.

> The web page components practice of the author, include:
>
> 1.  Keep the count of web page components to a minimum

>     not specify IDs, this is left to the browser\'s decision.
> 2.  Browsers place restrictions on the number of concurrent
>     connections to a particular domain and the overall parallel
>     connections. Consider spreading out the resources to multiple
>     domains.
> 3.  The author standardized on the .png image format because there are

> For Internet connections, the contributing factors include:
>
> 1.  Propagation delay - The consideration is the speed of light in the

>     the medium which may be (DSL, cable, fiber) in order of
>     performance. The speed of light, which was presumably constant,

>     research excludes other participants. The environment is
>     transplantable for other uses. The route and environment impose
>     limitations on the local host. The traceroute command on the Linux
>     operating system, or the similar tracert or pathping commands on
>     the Windows operating system, will give travel speed. The author
>     will look into the last-mile tendencies of the Internet Service

> 2.  Transmission delay - The time to input the packet into the link,
>     which is determined by the length of the packet and the data rate
>     of the link. On the author\'s behalf, the Bible book ID is
>     transmitted to the client and convertible to the title by
>     JavaScript. Formatting is done by the client.
> 3.  Processing delay - The duration of processing the header, detect
>     bit-level errors, and determine the other end. In an Intranet
>     environment, this is done locally.

### Backup and Off-site Storage

The author archives the database and source files to the local
computers, [Google](http://drive.google.com),
[Microsoft](http://onedrive.live.com) drives, [after
changes.]{dated="2021-07-24T16:00:00"} The author uses
[GitHub.com](http://github.com/KenAdeniji) version control.

### Development Time

The development time is separable into the time it takes to program,
compile, test, deploy. The stored procedure, C#, ASMX, HTML files are
build-able in one day, in most use-case.

### Reproducible

The deliverable of the author is transferable to other environments to
reach similar conclusions.

### Database Deployment

<div>

The author suggests the following alternative methods for deploying the
databases:

1.  [Restore](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/restore-statements-transact-sql)
2.  [Attach](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/attach-a-database)
3.  [Snapshot](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/create-a-database-snapshot-transact-sql)
4.  [SQL Server Data Definition Language
    (DDL)](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/SQLServerDataDefinitionLanguageDDL)

</div>

### Surrogate Keys

<div>

> The author takes advantage of potential natural primary keys;
> otherwise, the author uses surrogate keys. A surrogate key may be an
> identity or GUID type column. URIs are examples of natural primary
> keys.

### [GetAPage.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html) Program Flow

The event handlers are the first code the system executes. These are the
page load, submit click, item change events. If this is a page load
event, and it is not a
[postback](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postback), and the [query
string](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) has a word argument,
then the processing of the word occurs. If this is a postback, then it
is the user\'s data entry that the system processes. The term processing
means the browser submits the word to the back-end asynchronous web
services and renders each result.

### International Standard ISO/IEC 25010. Systems and Software Engineering \-- Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) \-- System and Software Quality Models. First Edition, 2011-03-01.

Software quality is demonstrable in eight characteristics:
maintainability, functional suitability, performance efficiency,
compatibility, usability, reliability, security, and portability.

#### Maintainability

##### Corrective Maintenance

This is error correction.

##### Adaptive Maintenance

Transition from building console to web applications.

##### Perfective Maintenance

The author now considers partial and lookback scripture references. Such
as, when there is no book title, then this default to the earlier book
title.

Choosing the right [.NET Framework Data
Providers](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/data-providers#net-framework-data-provider-for-sql-server-sqlclient).
The author standardized on ODBC; the other choices are OLE DB, or
SQLClient.

##### Preventive Maintenance

Servicing the system to avoid larger mishaps.

#### Metric Quality Profiles

##### Unit Size Quality Profiles

Determining the AlphabetSequence takes 325 lines of code, which starts
and callbacks 40 lines of AJAX code and concludes with 200 lines of
database interaction. A unit of code should not exceed 15 lines.

All the web services (.asmx) files return JSON by default; the
AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx file, Query method, returns a hand
crafted JSON which has a numeric AlphabetSequenceIndex and a string
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference.

##### Limit the number of branch points per unit to 4

The C# compiler will translate code to an intermediate language (IL).
This code runs Just In Time (JIT), according to the condition clauses
and operators.

In the case of dynamic SQL, re-compiling imposes cost.

>     2.  git add
>     3.  git commit
>     4.  git push

>     Python\'s Flask run on diversified ports.
> 8.  Concurrency: The author isolate his applications from the

> 9.  Disposability: The author\'s take on expendable work includes the
>     following:
>     -   Pure functions
>     -   On-demand compilation of web pages and services
>     -   Adjustable time-out setting for the database and web request
>         threads
>     -   The .NET Framework minute work, such as, the singleton design
>         pattern, and static method calling and variable(s)
>         initialization
> 10. Development/production parity: By first finalizing non repeatitive

>         the fly-by-night trends. Testing on the multiple operating
>         systems and the various programming languages reflects the
>         author\'s wish for compatibility. Prior to advent of the

All the words that the author hears while sleeping are recordable and
the author has never had any tendency to alter this utterance from the
LORD. When the author is awake and he says something, out of his own
volition and pre-meditation, he has massaged this information, but now
he rarely does so. The words in the past and future event dates are
useful for remembrance entries. As the author technically matures, he
automates manual work.

[DateDifference.aspx](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/DateDifference.aspx)
The .NET Framework, C# and SQL Server support the Common Era; the date
ranges between 0001-01-01 and 9999-12-31. The date difference will
display correctly for the time interval - days, Biblical Calendar, and
all the dates after the introduction of the Gregorian Calendar.

#### Declarative {#Declarative}

SQL, Linq, CSS are declarative languages, but JavaScript is a functional
language.

#### Contextual {#Contextual}

Enhancements to JavaScript, such as const and let influence hoisting. So
does script literal, strict mode, class.

The C# class container model and the optional namespace alias content
the author.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is modular, and its rules trickle down.

### Continuous {#Continuous}

Placing the [App_Offline.htm](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/426755)
file in the virtual directory of the web application will shut-down the
application, unload the application domain from the server, and stop
processing any new incoming requests for the application.

A single batch file, with a single command line, builds the only .dll,
InformationInTransit.dll\
` csc /out:InformationInTransit.dll /target:library /recurse:*.cs /reference:System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.dll,"bin\Debug\HtmlAgilityPack.dll","bin\Debug\iTextSharp.dll","bin\Debug\MongoDB.Bson.dll","bin\Debug\MongoDB.Driver.dll","bin\Debug\MongoDB.Driver.Core.dll","bin\Debug\Newtonsoft.Json.dll","C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\WPF\PresentationFramework.dll","bin\Debug\System.Speech.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.Dmf.Adapters.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.Dmf.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.DmfSqlClrWrapper.dll","C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Sdk.Sfc.dll",Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll /nowarn:162,168,219,618,649 /unsafe `\
After testing, InformationInTransit.dll is deployable to the
WordEngineering\'s virtual directory, bin sub-directory. This transfer
is via the xcopy command or the Microsoft Windows Explorer user
interface (UI).

When the content of a server-side file with an .aspx or .asmx extension
changes, the ASP.NET framework automatically re-compiles for serving
future requests.

[jQuery](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js) by John Resig is for
making Ajax calls to the server. The more recent fetch command is also
useful in later cases. jQuery helps to load the latest copy of the
author\'s JavaScript repository
[9432.js](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.js);
since browser caching occurs for JavaScript files for a length of time.

The single .css file
[9432.css](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.css)
is callable at the bottom of each .html file\'s head node; JavaScript
statements are in the last lines of the .html files. This means that the
browser knows how to show the HTML elements before reaching their
origination, and the browser\'s JavaScript engine will not reference a
HTML node before the declaration of its definition.

[Set a Database to Single-user
Mode](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/set-a-database-to-single-user-mode?view=sql-server-2017#TsqlProcedure)

            ALTER DATABASE WordEngineering
            SET SINGLE_USER
            WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
            GO
            ALTER DATABASE WordEngineering
            SET READ_ONLY;
            GO
            ALTER DATABASE WordEngineering
            SET MULTI_USER;     
                

If the research of the author is a team effort; the additional expense,
time and effort, in staged deployments, is justifiable; such as
development, test, production phases.

The author will place non-Microsoft DLLs in the virtual directory bin
sub-directory, and the author will refer to Microsoft DLLs in the
web.config file.

The web.config is generally consistent across deployment, the only
variable is the database server name, and when the application and
database server exists on the same machine, the connectionStrings may
use Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=master;Integrated Security=SSPI.
This means that the author will explictly specify the database, object
owner, and system object name. The Application pool will take care of
the security. There are no environment variables, in use, at this time.
The HTML files, when calling web services, will specify the full virtual
directory path, but when appending css and JavaScript files, relative
directories will suffice, full path directory and filename is
unnecessary and an overkill.

The author standardized on Microsoft SQL Server as the relational
database of choice. There are several alternatives in the market. All
database interaction goes through one access point,
[DataCommand.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/InformationInTransit/DataAccess/DataCommand.cs),
only this single file needs re-work if there is a database variety
change.

When running a unit of code, for the first time, it will initialize the
static variables. The
[ScriptureReference.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html)
will issue a unique quote-of-the-day, every day; and a random quote,
every time. The author program uses the release version of jQuery, which
is the most up-to-date. The web services, such as, Sefaria.org, should
not need code-revisit. The code in the third-party libraries, such as,
Newtonsoft.Json.dll, is consistent, and should rarely need
re-deployment.

The application is mostly stateless except for the database read.

Internet Information Server (IIS) HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) by
default runs on port 80, like other web servers, but this is modifiable.

Using the current architecture, the author takes care of concurrency and
deadlocks; because database writes rarely occur and are short, reads are
tolerant.

The threads are simple and conclusive; therefore, there are small
start-up and short-down periods.

There is unity between the development and production team, environment,
and time frame. The same knowledge worker can write, deploy, and run
code.

The author has experience, reporting web server logs, using
[WebTrends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webtrends). The author relies
on [Event Viewer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Viewer) for logging
and monitoring exceptions. The SQL Server Management Studio offers the
Error Log, for viewing the database activities.

The SQL Server Maintenance Plan is for scheduling full database and
transaction log backup, periodically.

### HTML5 {#HTML5}

#### Semantic Elements {#SemanticElements dated="2020-05-05T00:00:00"}

The author makes heavy use of the table semantic element for rendering
tabular information. The author uses the input element and specifies
either the text, number or date type attribute. The author tries the
canvas and video elements for proof-of-concept.

#### Non-Semantic Elements {#NonSemanticElements dated="2020-05-05T00:00:00"}

The div and span elements are for rendering block and in-line
information. The author uses the div as a container for the ubiquitous
result set; which may contain a single or multiple tables. [The span is
a space for a non-block display.]{dated="2020-10-06T14:28:00"}

> The head section contains the title and meta tags for search-engine

> following ascending order: CSS, HTML, JavaScript.

> HTML is an element\'s nodes. There are only single instances of the

### Literature Review {#LiteratureReview dated="2022-09-12T14:04:00"}

Reading improvement? The literature review and bibliography sections are
scanty and brief. The justification of the author is that in the
Internet age the references and content are available on-line, and
putting into words other people\'s work is not the author\'s core
strength. When the author recounts non-original thoughts, the author
mentions this.

Scalability: The users have various options for sizing up their work.
The author did not initially restrict the size of the data queried from
the server; therefore, there was information overload on the data grid
of the client. The tolerance for large data may be exacerbated
vertically and/or horizontally. There may be a high count of rows or
columns, thereby, demanding ranking and preferences for positioning.

### This data\...where does it exist? {#ThisDataWhereDoesItExist dated="2024-04-02T15:45:00"}

Legacy storage of some data types is unnecessary, since this data is
computable. For example, concordances are automatically determinable.
Dictionaries that contain the meaning of words are available on-line.
Computers provide up-to-date versions and translations.

::: {dated="2024-04-03T16:32:00"}
How-to display the data? After determining the
AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference the author currently retrieves
and displays in particular the King James Version (KJV) Bible text, and
the author provides a hyperlink to a scripture reference page for
displaying other Bible versions. This practice follows Google\'s display
of a Wikipedia\'s sidebar and providing a hyperlink to the particular
Wikipedia url. For Bible literates, this regurgitation may be redundant.
What programming skills are in demand?

1.  Issuing a SQL select, and using a cursor to loop through a tabular
    or variable output, and building an HTML fragment
2.  Simply creating a HTML anchor to a source url
3.  Fetching, parsing, and building the results of a web service

The Bible, dictionary and commentary databases should be accessible from
central locations, and there should be no need for user storage. For the
URI database, the date of publication is constant, [but the date
accessed may vary by users.]{dated="2023-11-12T18:13:00"} Storing
user\'s information is achievable by using local and session storage,
cookies, and bookmarks. The date of publication recognition is
determinable from Google\'s last update and YouTube.com. The directory

Divided as separated. Go this way, that way.

I want to program, but I don\'t want to match two programs together,
except for deep thought.

See when God grants increase; such as in creation, when God counts the
days, and separates it into evening and morning. Increase versus
decrease were first explicitly mentioned during Noah\'s flood. These
differences in size we can associate with signs - the sun and the moon.
During the day, you need the sun for your activities; during the
evening, it is not necessary. Rachel\'s prayer, and naming of Joseph;
Joseph\'s dreams and interpretations. These counting is explicit, before
Exodus, such as, the 10 plagues of Egypt ( [Genesis 37:5-11, Genesis
30:24, Genesis
40-41](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2037:5-11,%20Genesis%2030:24,%20Genesis%2040-41)
).

[TCP/IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) is
separable into four layers; these are the link, Internet, transport and
application layers. No breaking ( [Matthew
19:8](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%2019:8)
).

#### Marriage

Marriage is not a practice, in the life after, resurrection ( [Matthew
22:30, Mark 12:25, Luke 20:35, Revelation 21:2, 2 Corinthians
11:2](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%2022:30,%20Mark%2012:25,%20Luke%2020:35,%20Revelation%2021:2,%202%20Corinthians%2011:2)
). Co-incidentally, the disciple, who Jesus love, John the apostle, does
not mention this event, in the Gospel of John. [ [It is more of a father
that wants
you.](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html?word=It%20is%20more%20of%20a%20father%20that%20wants%20you.)
]{dated="2022-04-21T08:40:00"} Jesus resurrected, after three days (
[Matthew 12:40, Matthew 26:61, Matthew 27:40, Matthew 27:63, Mark 8:31,
Mark 14:58, Mark 15:29, Luke 2:46, John 2:19, John 2:20, 2 Corinthians
11:2, Revelation 21:2, Revelation 21:9, Revelation
22:17](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%2012:40,%20Matthew%2026:61,%20Matthew%2027:40,%20Matthew%2027:63,%20Mark%208:31,%20Mark%2014:58,%20Mark%2015:29,%20Luke%202:46,%20John%202:19,%20John%202:20,%202%20Corinthians%2011:2,%20Revelation%2021:2,%20Revelation%2021:9,%20Revelation%2022:17)
). The breaking of device ( [Psalms 34:20, John
19:36](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Psalms%2034:20,%20John%2019:36)
).

On the client, HTML is content, CSS is presentation, and JavaScript is
behavior. Both ASPX and ASMX are server-side logic.

The application tier is in a dynamic link library (DLL), and it is
separable into client, database, and application logics, but with the
advent of language integrated query (Linq), this delineation is slowly
diminishing. Linq rivals previous division of labor.

The database consists of tables, views, indexes, constraints, stored
procedures and functions. These programming logic may be SQL or SQLCLR.
SQL critics complain that while the rest of software development have
progressed, we still use an archaic language; NoSQL is a challenger.

#### Visibility ( [John 4](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%204) )

The client is accessible from the browser, both the user interface and
the source code, along with the errors and exceptions. The interface is
made-up of request and response. Text-to-Speech will aid the people with
poor visibility. The client handles the human computer interface (HCI).
The Bible versions are selectable options in HTML or JavaScript.

The database contains the real information, that makes-up the result
set.

#### Lifecycle ( [John 3:3, John 3:7](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%203:3,%20John%203:7) )

In computing, we have had mainframes and terminals, client/server,
Internet, mobile and now cloud. The trend has been from proprietary to
open architecture.

#### Accompany ( [Matthew 4:6, Matthew 18:10](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%204:6,%20Matthew%2018:10) )

What are the pairing?

The client started as HTML, but now has JavaScript and CSS.

CGI originally served the back-end. Flash and plug-ins have made way for
other technology, such as HTML5 video and canvas.

JSON and XML have made in-roads.

    When I get a word from God I could do the following?
    1.  Write the word in my notepad, and never refer to it again.
    2.  Record the word in the WordEngineering database, HisWord table,
        word column, and associate the accompanying columns.
    3.  Produce an artifact based on the word.

#### Information Flow {#information-flow dated="2020-08-04T21:00:00"}

> Sharing His word; is following His deed.

(Charles M. Kozierok).

With .asmx web services, the author, standardized on JSON for returning
data. The alternative is XML. The preference for JSON, is because of its
lighter payload. Another difference, in the result set, the author
chooses if to return a dataset, datatable, or scalar? The datatable is
useful for a singular resultset. With SQL Query select statements, the
column list may refer to \*, for returning all the columns, in the order
they are arranged in the container, table or view; or otherwise the
stricter, specification of each column to return. The author restricts
which rows to return, by issuing the conditional where clause; the top 1
select clause is useful, for quote of the day; as it supercedes the set
rowcount 1, limitation. The author depends on the database order by
clause, for sorting in ascending or descending order, Data is also
rankable by clicking on the table\'s column header.

##### Basic Communication Modes of Operation {#basic-communication-modes-of-operation dated="2020-08-07T22:15:00"}

The author\'s SQL Server TCP/IP is turned off; because the author does
not want interference from the outside. The author imposes an artificial
Simplex Operation; only supporting external read requests, and not
allowing updates; which is a one-way traffic of data from the server to
the clients. The other options are Half-Duplex Operation and Full-Duplex
Operation.

##### Quality of Service (QoS) {#quality-of-service-qos dated="2020-08-07T22:53:00"}

Most of the author\'s web pages transmit textual data; but a few pages
offer text-to-speech or video capabilities; these rare application rely
on high-grade speciality. The author as a programmer does not meddle
with these intricacies; the technology provider takes care of the
nitty-grity.

##### Parameter Standardization {#parameter-standardization dated="2020-08-10T06:21:00"}

The column name is kept consistent in the query string, up-to the naming
convention and the case-sensitivity; this also applies to where we
specifically refer to a column name in JavaScript. This is most seen, in
the Scripture reference and Bible word variables, which the author
shares around.

##### Global Resource Allocation and Identifier Uniqueness {#global-resource-allocation-and-identifier-uniqueness dated="2020-08-10T06:42:00"}

The domain name is unique to the organization; and the Javascript code
for AJAX explicitly mentions the virtual directory; the internet
provider issues the IP address.

> 1.  Productivity is the measure of unit tasks completed within a time
>     frame or at a cost.
> 2.  A project cost is its work hours. A work day is 8 hours. A work
>     month is ≈176 work hours. A work year is ≈2000 work hours.
> 3.  The degree of conceptual complexity increases when an expression
>     contains various function calls and many parentheses. Scope
>     complexity is the fitting between parts.
> 4.  To predict productivity? Re-use.
> 5.  Metric:
>     -   Executable Size Metric: Is the code largeness. It does not
>         fully consider the uninitialized array data. It includes
>         library code which reduces complexity. It is not a
>         language-independent source. It is not CPU-independent.
>     -   Machine Instructions Metric: This is the size or count of the
>         machine instructions.
>     -   Lines of Code Metric (LOC): It counts the number of source
>         code lines. It is consistent across programming languages. It
>         is CPU-independent. The Linux word count, wc, command will
>         suffice.
>     -   Statement Count Metric: It excludes comments, blank lines, and
>         counts as 1 a statement that spreads across multiple lines.
>     -   Function Point Analysis (FPA): It looks ahead and assumes the
>         amount of work a program will require. It details the inputs,
>         outputs and basic computation. FPA has become a postmortem
>         (end-of-project) tool.
>     -   McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity Metric developed by Thomas
>         McCabe: It finds out the complexity by determining the paths
>         through it.

### Web Site Performance Metrics

The load time, and response time to user action and submission. The
author tested the time, it takes to load each page, after development;
and the wait period was satisfactory. For the Bible database, the author
does not expect further increase in database size, which will put
premium on the load. [Ahmdal\'s
Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law) comes into recognition
in
[GetAPage.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/GetAPage.html),

In Australia, I got involved with the prison ministry at the Villawood
Detention Center. The Christian missionaries that were serving felt that
fellow migrants might aid in responding to new applicants. I was
deported to my country of origin, Nigeria, from the United States of
America (USA); therefore, I could share the plight of these inmates. I
was also in the court process, so I could better understand Australia\'s
law. Finally, my most productive contract consulting was at the
Department of Training Education Committee (DTEC), so I had an
understanding of integrating and skilling re-locating workers. I tried
to share computer books, but inmates were undaunted by their relevance
to their misery. They were expected to write letters to immigration
officials. This influenced my desire to practice authoring Christian
literature and improve my communication. How could I relate to less
fortunate people? How may I be the one giving? How can I let the Holy
Spirit partake on my side? What are these roles for, and how will I be a
mediator? What do I share as a bargain? All these are words to say. What
do I mean as a human being? Where does the spirit hold its own?
Computers are programmable, humans are useful. Where does a side take
the rest? What I am finding out, is how necessary I am as a person? How
do I do my part in participating? What can you take from me, and make as
your own? My words may not be what you will say, but how can your
experience let you say? Imagine your life will be lived, as you say.
When the times, programming lines, lines of code, play out a scenario.
So words make meaning as sufficiency. Whose life have I lived to
complexity? To the full of His deed (
[John%2015:24](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%2015:24)
)? What can His prove relate to me?

### What do you want to use it for? {#WhatDoYouWantToUseItFor dated="2021-06-07T21:09:00"}

It is firstly, a database work. That is the author records God\'s word.
What the author hears, he relates to the Bible and the other scriptural
sources. These information are all in database tables, giving the author
the luxury of using relational technology. The benefit includes storage
and archive, that is, the work is usable in tabular format. There is a
copy of the information running Microsoft SQL Server on a Linux
operating system; which the author switches to, by changing the database
connection string of one node in the web.config. When the user decides
to stabilize and admit no further changes; then there is no need to do
additional database update work. As with such work, the database schema
remains consistent, since the beginning. The choice of word, meets
today\'s expectations. The addition of the ActToGod table, demonstrates
the maturity of the author, [ since it advances from data to
information. ]{dated="2024-04-25T17:49:00"}

The author, first wrote his history, in multiple stand-alone files
.HTML, .XML. ([Acts
7:22](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Acts%207:22)).
This documentation didn\'t allow for enough dating, to track creation
and change, nor easy querying. Therefore, the decision to move to a
relational database; that will augment this fact.

Since the beginning, the author wrote a ContactMaintenance.aspx
server-side page as a user-interface (UI) to record contact information.
This page remains active, till today.

The author uses Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to document
general information. When the author is offsite, text editors provides a
place to scribble data manipulation language (DML) statements into SQL
script files, for later execution. Please understand that both means
mentioned above do not always support the checking of spellings nor
grammar, and have limited formatting.

I have a product; where is the method?

::: {dated="2021-06-07T06:42:00"}
Adoptability:

1.  What is the minimum requirement? The author believes it is the Holy
    Spirit spreading the Word, and it is not him, making up the word. As
    long as you have the spirit of God, then you are receptive to this
    information sharing. The word is not always clearly heard, and the
    sighting is not always 20/20 visibile.
2.  What is the literacy level requirement? If you know the alphabets
    arrangements, then you can determine the AlphabetSequenceIndex by
    hand. To determine the AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference, you
    need to know, the count of chapters and verses. This manual work
    gives way to computation, which is not error prone.
3.  The Biblical account wrote dreams and visions textually, without
    resorting to the database. Search Engines Crawlers parse the
    standard HTML files and rarely query the database. The calendar:
    years, months, days, may benefit from the stipulation and
    generability of the Common Era.
4.  Where is the world leading and how do we follow it? The author
    fiddles with the idea of bringing technology to the Word of God. The
    author is unaware of the start and early beginnings of dictionaries,
    concordance and commentaries; but the author gains from this works
    as a reference. The widely acception of a work, accompanies
    preference and prevalence.
5.  The result of the Bible, is how we use it. The emphasises of Jesus
    Christ and apostle Paul is the word for today? As the author sees
    from the Bible, Moses assigned intervention to leaders, and Moses
    went to God as a higher authority. Who is the work for? Who can
    benefit from reading this work?

-   The Microsoft Windows Operating System offers the clipboard copy
    command. When using the Mozilla Firefox browser and copying the
    address bar, the author selectively only copies the domain name and
    leaves out the protocol when it is http or https. This saves storage
    space, since this is the default protocol. When copying information
    from the page, please note that there may be leading blank spaces,
    which requires truncation.
-   Difficulty level? Our work is divisible into writing the word,
    commentary, and deducting meaning. When the word is from God, the
    data entry is easy when it is in English, except when it is in
    Yoruba, where there may be spelling and substitution errors. The
    commentary does not have to be exact, since it is an inference.
    Determining the correlation between people, places, and historical
    information, may require expertise. What I am able to do is how He
    types me. As I wrote this paragraph, I entered in my own words and I

    United States of America (USA) on 1999-01-18. I observed my twin
    sibling built web pages and databases tracking contacts, websites
    (URL), and software. When I re-located to Newark, California (CA)

    twin sibling, I did not find software a growing technology trend. I
    understood I wanted to have a database for contacts and websites
    (URL), but I did not continue in the tradition of my twin sibling of
    using his adopted technology, schema, user-interface (UI), nor

### Progress

After the author conceived the notion for AlphabetSequence, he stored
the word spoken into XML files, along with manually determining the
relevant Bible word. This, the author did, because the author thought
and felt that the readers will prefer to read the recent information,
and they do not have to regurgitate the entire database. The author was
living at Newark, and working from Fremont.

The author recorded, the FromUntil Time Span, explicitly into the
Remember\'s table commentary column. Now, there are three computed
columns, managing this period(s); these are the days difference, the
Biblical time period, and Common Era computation. The author is saving
memory storage space this way. And, also offering the opportunity to
other people, the possibility to calculate their preferred period.

Using the knowledge learnt from horizontal replication and partition,
the audience are no longer forced to accept the author\'s calendar. The
audience can choose their acceptable fact, and ignore nor standard
derivation.

The history, this way, is to say; at the begining, the author will
record every entry after six p.m. as the next day saying, just like the
Jewish day starts at 6 p.m. With the reasoning advent, the Tanakh, the
New Testament, and the Koran, the truth partiality, is our governance.

### The Basic of Facilitating the Truth

Most words have precedence, and do not exist in an emptiness. Words
follow a trend. Are their supportive collaboration, to the utterance the
author hears; these are linkable for historical evidence.

How do we give our actualities? I have found written text, the easiest
and most applicable way of sharing thoughts. Words spoken, when passed
from generation to generation, may gain legend status, and therefore,
lose appropriateness.

Examine the course of history? You will find, that most truth, are
actually realizing the dream. In my case, when I try to recall, the
past, I search by keywords, numbers and dates. So, entries in the word,
are most to realization. The first words spoken have higher importance
and closer affinity; so also, prophetic application, have standard
occurrence.

Our work, so much depends on data entry. The Remember table relies on
relationship, deductive reasoning.

### Can we look back at history, as we precede our future

#### An angel said to prophet Daniel, many shall run to and fro ( [Daniel%2012:4](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Daniel%2012:4) )

Is this phenomenal traceable, Biblically, and can we name a person that
bears similar resemblance? When we study, king David, we can see that
David fled from king Saul, his predecessor; and two of his biological
immediate sons, who purported, to overthrow him as king. In the Book of
Revelation, the only three mentions of king David, talk of movement (
[Revelation 3:7, Revelation 5:5, Revelation
22:16](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Revelation%203:7,%20Revelation%205:5,%20Revelation%2022:16)
). [ Joseph ( [Genesis 37:2, Genesis 37:9, Genesis 37:19, Genesis
39:12-18](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2037:2,%20Genesis%2037:9,%20Genesis%2037:19,%20Genesis%2039:12-18)
). ]{dated="2022-07-22T15:25:00"}

#### Why we Accumulate the Same ( [Matthew 26:53, Revelation 9:16, Revelation 7:4-8](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%2026:53,%20Revelation%209:16,%20Revelation%207:4-8) )

Samuel anointed David, during king Saul\'s reign. The choice, one makes,
ahead ( [Genesis 2:2-3, 2 Samuel 11:4, 2 Samuel 12:24, Ruth 3:1, Ruth
3:8, Ruth
3:18](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%202:2-3,%202%20Samuel%2011:4,%202%20Samuel%2012:24,%20Ruth%203:1,%20Ruth%203:8,%20Ruth%203:18)
). Knew versus lay.

### Wanting a Member of\...

In the first words, in the Bible, God referred to the beginning, of His
work, giving time, an annotation. God also mentioned two places, heaven
and earth, creation generally centers on the activities on the earth;
and God we understand, resides in the heaven, the last point for good on
earth. To seek a development; it had a beginning.

In the second sentence, second verse, God mentions, that the earth was
without form and void; meaning the earth was without content. Nothing
was a member of the earth. Also, God\'s spirit, a member of God, moved
across the water.

When time is maximal used; time is ideal allowed. When our association
to follow; is association to the end.

AlphabetSequence is a novice attempt to tie what the author hears to the
Bible. As one reads the Bible, they have a more familiar method of
communicating. As we begin today, how can we let tomorrow?

That is what we are trying to say, how can we make ample use of time?
Word of God. Word from God? The commentary is a human interpretation.
You can fit more into time, by making a luxury of time. Why do we have
to repeat the meaning in our words? Bible dictionary and commmentary. As
a result of who are we? When does the scenario introduce God ( [Genesis

  Accessor Pattern           Get and set an attribute by using a property.                                                                                                     The boundary to a property value. Readonly is achievable by disabling the set method.                                                                                    
  Delegation Pattern         Composition substitutes for inheritance.                                                                                                          The author does not inherit any class. But the author delegates by using composition to include existing services.                                                       [BibleBook.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/main/InformationInTransit/ProcessLogic/BibleBook.cs)
  Factory Pattern            Create subclasses from one or more methods.                                                                                                       At runtime, instantiate a variable object.                                                                                                                               [BallFactory.java](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/main/Java/DougLowe/JavaAll-In-OneForDummies/BallFactory.java)
  Immutable Pattern          An immutable object is unchangeable after creation.                                                                                               A string object is immutable. Although behind the scenes a string object is a reference type, it is treatable like a value type. A StringBuilder object is changeable.   
  Marker interface Pattern   The marker interface pattern is empty. It is metadata that refers to additional work. Examples in Java include Cloneable, Remote, Serializable.   A class may implement the cloneable interface to identify support for the clone method, which may perform shallow or deep copy.                                          [BibleBook.java](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/main/Java/DougLowe/JavaAll-In-OneForDummies/BibleBook.java)
  Singleton Pattern          Only a single instance is createable.                                                                                                             At Daigaku Honyaku Center (DHC) there was a database table which is a reference and contains a single record.

> ### Unified Modeling Language (UML) {#UnifiedModelingLanguage(UML) dated="2023-03-11T13:13:00"}

(Unified Modeling Language)

#### Common Structure {#UnifiedModelingLanguage(UML)CommonStructure dated="2023-03-11T13:13:00"}

UML composes elements and relationships as in its predecessor
Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams.

A model contains elements which may have descendants for
specializations. A contact may have children such as addresses. When a
contact is removed, this cascades to the removal of its children.

Comments do not impact programatically, they only serve as guides for
readers.

A directed relationship may exist between a collection of source and
target.

A namespace is a container separator.

An import facilitates the admittance of an external namespace.

Types and multiplicity restrict the units of information. For example, a
scripture reference can only identify book titles, chapters and verses.
For the King James Version of the Bible, the cardinality of the books is
66.

A constraint represents the range of valid values that a member may
have.

A dependency replicates changes between the supplier/client.

#### Value {#UnifiedModelingLanguage(UML)Value dated="2023-03-11T16:15:00"}

Lack of a value is null. A data type may place its own degree of
significance on a value. For example integer versus (VS) decimal, date
versus (VS) datetime.

A string is a combination of alphabets, numbers and symbols. For
example, as in scripture reference, when it may concatenate Bible book
titles, chapters, verses, and separators.

An integer is a whole number. For example, BibleReference which consists
of Book ID, chapter and verse.

A Boolean is either true or false and it is normally used for
validation.

A real is a number with decimal relevance, such as ratios and
percentages.

#### Classification {#UnifiedModelingLanguage(UML)Classification dated="2023-03-13T21:16:00"}

This work is largely based on migrating from free-text to relational
data. Classification serves well with scripture reference pre and post,
and book titles, chapters and verses. The C# language class
instantiations occur in
[ScriptureReferenceHelper.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/main/InformationInTransit/ProcessLogic/ScriptureReferenceHelper.cs){target="_blank"}
[Exact.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/main/InformationInTransit/ProcessLogic/Exact.cs){target="_blank"}

The author\'s work has not featured inheritance. There are no
generalizations, parents, nor specializations, children, classes. A
substitution for this is an interface, such as, IScriptable
[UtilitySQLServerManagementObjectsSMO.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordOfGod2/blob/master/UtilitySQLServerManagementObjectsSMO.cs){target="_blank"}
A child may override a parent\'s virtual member.

In the C# language, an abstract class is static, not instantiable. A
static class may contain extension methods.

Signals and receptions are similar to events and handlers. A page load
or close is an asynchronous signal that its subscribers handle
separately. A click event is triggered and resolved internally.

Microsoft .Net supports components such as a pre-compiled dynamic link
library (.dll), and compiling web forms and web services at first
request. Web form matured from code-behind to code-beside.

For the Java language, there must be a correlation between package and
directory names. Microsoft .Net does not impose such consistency. [ But
the author abides by this rule. ]{dated="2023-03-16T12:42:00"
scripturereference="Daniel 9:24-27"}

In C# version 9, a method may offer a covariant return type.

    (USA)
    1.  During my 3 Associate degrees\' graduation ceremony, Doctor
        Richard Hagemeyer asked if I would like to go to Africa?
    2.  At Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC), I tutored in the
        personal computer (PC) laboratory with Laura Lawhorne and her
        African-American female supervisor.
    3.  My first contract was at Sunhealth Corporation.
    4.  At Central Corporation I was a technician with 2 African
        American females, that probably attended school together, and
        then lived together. The telephone operators were mostly African
        American females, including my stepmother.
    5.  At McKey Real-Estate, I was contracted to develop an R:Base 5000
        5GL application.

1.  When making man, God made some choices?
    1.  Form: In His image
    2.  Location: Garden of Eden
    3.  Vocation: Caretaker
    4.  Helper: Eve
    5.  Model: First man, mother of all the living.
2.  How can we resemble His use?
    1.  As a software engineer, I replicate my work.
    2.  When I first started, I automated my manual task. I was working
        remotely, first at my work place, and later away from my family.
    3.  I initially saw my task as a software engineer, but later as a
        knowledge worker. Specializing on how to use and [bring
        God.]{dated="2023-11-09T17:48:00"}
    4.  I could start my day, reading the news, or scripture of the day.
        But for some time now, I have done [data entry of the previous

    supportive information in the other columns on the HisWord table.
    The information in the other tables, such as, the Remember, APass,
    ActToGod tables are extractable and computable from the HisWord
    table.
2.  2025-01-15T15:29:00 Teachable: Can a student learn to generate this
    data, as you have? The only pre-requisite is the Holy Spirit.
3.  2025-01-15T15:42:00 Textual: The author hears the word. The author
    is able to transcribe the words. The accent of the author is not
    fluent. The author is not artistically inclined, nor trained at
    capturing and transmitting audio or video.
4.  2025-01-15T16:02:00 Customization: How is this word supposed to be
    used? When the author receives the word, he makes effort to
    temporarily record the word on paper. At a convenient time, the
    author records the word on a computer electronically.

1.  2025-02-08T22:32:00 Going along with the prognosis of the LORD, I
    feel my best utilization at the moment is to re-cap my history. To
    look at how I technically made decisions, in light of the spirit.
    With Chuck Missler as a mentor, he led information technology
    companies, and tutored Bible classes. Not to explain the Bible, but
    give an understanding of scripture. I found out at PowerSoft that my
    software engineering skills were not fully developed during my
    Master\'s degree programme at the University of Technology, Sydney
    (UTS). It may be that I did understand the paradigm shift,
    client/server, or specifically, PowerBuilder? Master-slave lacking.
    I had not led a team software project, nor taught a non-technical
    female student to transition into software engineering. These
    opportunities and challenges to train a female prodigy include:
    -   The Iranian Persian female student at Central Piedmont Community
        College (CPCC), personal computer (PC) laboratory 3 Pascal
        programs.
    -   Teaching Hajara Adeola a French lecturer, the wife of Fola
        Adeola, the co-founder of Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB), how to use
        a personal computer (PC).
    -   Helping Jenny Stevens of Powersoft with how-to use a
        client/server tool as a spreadsheet.
2.  -   At Electronic Data Systems (EDS)/Westpac the reference table had
        a composite primary key that consisted of major and minor
        columns.
    -   At Daigaku Honyaku Center (DHC) the reference table I wrongly
        implemented as a singleton instance.
3.  Up-to-now, what I have are raw ideas which need refinery expertise.

In looking at the Bible, a decision was made to separate it into 2
parts, the former Old Testament, and the latter New Testament. This
offered the Jews the opportunity to retain the Tanakh. This influenced
the calendar breaking into B.C. and A.D. The Moslems, disillusioned with
the proprietary Bible, got the Koran. 2024-10-28T05:45:00 [A decision

The 3 private sectors jobs I held in Charlotte, North Carolina (NC)
were:

1.  At Sunhealth Corporation, I upgraded a Microsoft Basic application
    to add columns to a printed report. Frank Veale worked on a database
    application for dating.
2.  At Central Corporation, I upgraded a Borland Turbo C application to
    generate an additional tape print label.
3.  At McKey Real Estate, I worked on a R:base 5000 application.

These 3 non-academic Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC) tutor
jobs offered me the opportunity to complement my programming career with
writing.

What is the certaincy of the word:

-   When the author hears a word and there is a reference to a place in
    the Bible, this affirms the word\'s relevance to the Scripture.
-   Grammatically correctness is also vital.
-   If a word correlates with a historical event, then it is credible.
-   When the Spirit leads and guides towards an utterance ( [Matthew
    10:19-20](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%2010:19-20)
    ).

### To whose advantage am I?

In every scenario, we participate in, our last outcome should be holy (
[2 Samuel
12:14](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=2%20Samuel%2012:14)
). Future study, may consider the actors in the Bible, and award their
holiness in each scenario.

### Centeredness {#centeredness dated="2017-03-21T07:33:00"}

This is our attempt to find follow-up, continuity in the Bible. A brief
repetition of our activities, subsequently. Firmer consequence ( [Isaiah
23:15, Isaiah 23:17, Jeremiah 25:11, Jeremiah 25:12, Jeremiah 29:10,
Daniel 9:2, Zechariah
7:5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Isaiah%2023:15,%20Isaiah%2023:17,%20Jeremiah%2025:11,%20Jeremiah%2025:12,%20Jeremiah%2029:10,%20Daniel%209:2,%20Zechariah%207:5)
). Listed below are some of the repeated reinforcements.

#### Samson\'s Birth ( [Judges 13](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Judges%2013) )

An angel of the LORD appears to the wife of Manoah and prophesy that she
will give birth to a Nazarite son ( [Judges
13:2-5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Judges%2013:2-5)
).

The same angel appears to Manoah and his wife ( [Judges
13:6-25](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Judges%2013:6-25)
). The angel reinforces the their responsibility and defers reverence to
God.

#### The Birth of the Messiah ( [Luke 1](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Lukev1) )

Foretelling the birth of John the Baptist ( [Luke 1:5-25, Malachi
4:5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%201:5-25,%20Malachi%204:5)
). Transitioning the present to the after ( [Luke
1:17](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%201:17)
).

Foretelling the birth of Jesus Christ ( [Luke
1:26-38](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%201:26-38)
). Continuing the Davidic line ( [Luke 1:32-33, 2 Samuel 7:12-13, 2
Samuel
7:16](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%201:32-33,%202%20Samuel%207:12-13,%202%20Samuel%207:16)
).

#### The Baptism of Cornelius ( [Acts 10](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Acts%2010) )

The Bible does not explicitly mention the citizenship of Cornelius, but
it mentions his rank as a centurion in the Italian band ( [Acts
10:1](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Acts%2010:1)
).

Simon Peter is a fisherman, but without the LORD\'s presence, fishery is
not sustaining ( [Luke 5:4-11, John 21:3-6, Matthew 17:24-27, Acts
10:9-16](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%205:4-11,%20John%2021:3-6,%20Matthew%2017:24-27,%20Acts%2010:9-16)
). What I bring to Him; is me alone, to value Him.

### Full Position {#FullPosition}

The first occurrence of the word, full, in the Bible, occurs in (
[Genesis
14:10](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2014:10)
); and is in reference to the vale of Siddim, which was full of slime
pits, and this is where the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell.
The father of the faithful, Abraham, died, full of years, and the son of
promise, Isaac, died, full of days ( [Genesis 25:8, Genesis
35:29](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2025:8,%20Genesis%2035:29)
); The last occurrence of the word, full, in the Bible, occurs in (
[Revelation
21:9](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Revelation%2021:9)
). Living a presence ( [Jeremiah
28:11](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Jeremiah%2028:11)
). To creating a future full of all. To creating a future free of all.

### One Chance; Seem the Rest. {#OneChanceSeemTheRest}

Our LORD\'s prayer is a communal prayer; directed to the one God (
[Matthew 6:9-13, Luke
11:2-4](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%206:9-13,%20Luke%2011:2-4)
). Please note that it is Jesus; teaching this prayer; so He doesn\'t
refer to Himself or the Holy Spirit explicitly; as in another passage,
when He mentions Himself as the bread ( [John
6:31-35](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%206:31-35)
). He explains the truth; that we may fall short of it, by explicitly
referring to the Father. He is alluding to the events in the apocalyptic
books, Daniel and Revelation. We are on earth, and we have an earthly
father; where we are, is not where, we wish and will to reside (
[Matthew 6:9, Luke 11:2, Daniel 2, Revelation
5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Matthew%206:9,%20Luke%2011:2,%20Daniel%202,%20Revelation%205)
). When no matter, where I go; this is how, I Am found ( [John
20:17](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%2020:17)
).

### To set everything true {#ToSetEverythingTrue}

The word,
[true](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=true),
occurs in seventy-seven verses in the Scripture Bible, and there are
eighty-one occurrences. True, first occurs in Joseph\'s interaction with
his brothers ( [Genesis 42:11, Genesis 42:19, Genesis 42:31, Genesis
42:33, Genesis
42:34](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2042:11,%20Genesis%2042:19,%20Genesis%2042:31,%20Genesis%2042:33,%20Genesis%2042:34)
); Jacob had colluded with Rebecca, his mother, to get Isaac, his
father\'s, blessing; God shows that Joseph will have elevation over his
parents and siblings. There are ten occurrences of the word, true, in
the book of (
[Revelation](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Revelation)
); in response, to God.

### To Whom Masculine?

How the Bible compares the gender?

#### Man, after his Fall

During Creation, God asked all living things, be fruitful and multiply;
God asked Adam to name the living creatures, and God required Adam to
take care of the Garden of Eden, but this taking care is to dress and
keep the garden; there is a role for man, the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, and the tree of life. God did not specify the welfare of
animals. Out of Adam, God made a helper for Adam, Eve.

After the Fall of Man, Adam\'s labor will be thorough; and there is
enmity between the serpent and Eve, and each other\'s seed; and Eve will
have pain, during child-birth.

God made coats of skins, and clothed them; it is our presumption, that
the clothing is from living things, generally perceived as sin
sacrificial animal(s), but since this clothing is not specified, an
alternative, is that it is a plant, or another creature entirely.

God created an adult male, Adam; and his female counterpart, Eve (
[Deuteronomy 2:14, John
5:5](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Deuteronomy%202:14,%20John%205:5)
). There is no mention of Adam\'s activity, after the fall of man; as
Eve bares and name their children; Adam\'s earlier effort, which was to
cater for the Garden of Eden and name the animals.

#### Man at Birth

We can only suggest, that the struggle between good and evil, continues
upon the birth of Cain, Abel, and Seth. Eve named Cain, as her
possession; and Seth, as the appointed seed.

God instituted male circumcision, which should take place on the eighth
day, as man\'s responsibility in keeping the Abrahamic covenant.

At times, there is proclamation of a mantle, before livelihood; as in
the case of Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Samson, John the Baptist, and Jesus
Christ. In each example, there is a relationship between God and a
parent; and God is directing, the offspring\'s onus. The want similar to
Christ; is to see yourself, among fold.

#### Man\'s Task

Historical man\'s profession are keeper of sheep, a tiller of the
ground, handle the harp and organ, an instructor of every artificer in
brass and iron. Unlike the first men, in the Bible, Seth\'s service was
not identified, we only know that after the birth of Seth\'s son, Enos,
men began to call, on the name of the LORD.

The 10 Commandments details the relationship we aspire to have with God,
and our fellow-men.

God may consign men to overseer, as in the case of Melchizedek king of
Salem, the priest of the most high God, and collector of tithes; Joseph,
dreamer and interpreter, and he will save much life, in Egypt; as in
incorporating the end. We share among us; as no foundation separates us.

### Our choice is where we want to be? What we want to be?

A choice between what you have, and what you will want? ( [Revelation
5:5, Matthew 1:25, Luke 2:7, Romans 8:29, Colossians 1:15, Colossians
1:18, Hebrews 11:28, Hebrews
12:23](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Revelation%205:5,%20Matthew%201:25,%20Luke%202:7,%20Romans%208:29,%20Colossians%201:15,%20Colossians%201:18,%20Hebrews%2011:28,%20Hebrews%2012:23)
). Where I take you; is where you belong ( [Genesis 13:14-18,
Deuteronomy
34](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2013:14-18,%20Deuteronomy%2034)
).

The select inputs do not have default values.

The Scripture table is a one-to-one mapping between the Bible version
and column. These arrangements are futile when there are inconsistencies
in the Bibles versions separations. An alternative is to have a table
for each version. Publishers issue Bible version.

What does the Bible teach us about twins? Full-Text search? We have
given preference to the word, not the commentary, which is subjective.

    This is the most raw form of querying the database, but it offers
    the most flexibility, and it does not restrict, to pre-built
    application.
2.  Navigate the web pages from a client browser

relationship?

#### WordToNumberHelper.cs

Numbers in the Bible are written out as words. The author made effort to
parse these words and find the numbers, but it was not totally
successful, largely because of the arrangement of the numerals.

#### Translate the Original AlphabetSequence C# Code to the Other Programming Languages

<div>

AlphabetSequence was first implemented in the C# programming language
[AlphabetSequence.cs](http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/InformationInTransit/ProcessLogic/AlphabetSequence.cs)
Later work, saw translation to:

Perhaps, other programming languages should have their own sample code.

will be to see the use in other lingua franca. [And, the priest said,

#### Data Residence

Where should the data reside? Database, JSON or XML files?

#### Which side, the love felt?

SQL returns records in rows; there is a result set. Would we, be able,
to amalgate the result set? For example, how can we, find themes in the
Bible? When you enter a topic, can we return a trend? Clustering, can we
return a number; as its present ( [1 Kings
19:11-13](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=1%20Kings%2019:11-13)
)?

#### Where I arrive, is where He as conclusively use

Initially, when I got a word, I made efforts to expound, on this word;
but now, I share the word, and wait on God to reinforce the word, or
share a new theme.

2019-05-30 My ancestral home is Ile-Ife, the site of the Oranmiyan
staff. My search for the word,
[Staff](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=staff&logic=and),
inspired relating the Bible to my life. Staff, first occurs in, (
[Genesis
32:10](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2032:10)
). In my ninth year, my twin sibling and I, relocated from Ile-Ife Staff
School to Lagos. In our tenth year, we visited London. In my 32nd year,
I re-located to the United States of America (USA).

God intended man, to be a personal use. The work of the author is an
individual effort, and it targets a singular person. The author
separates his work into web pages, but the user may click on a
hyperlink, to get more information, and sometime do additional work. The
work of the author, builds on the efforts of other people, like the
Bible, dictionary and commentary. The HisWord table and associated
queries, only currently refers to the contribution of the author. How
could we, specialize our work? Who uses, and for what? The setting, is
it normal? What are the influence of God, as a person? What are His
contribution, solely to man? What part of Him, as He analyzed, as a
person? What role, as man, placed on Me? What stimulate you, as a human
being; is where My opinion placed? The author read the Bible and
listened to His word, prior to the introduction of AlphabetSequence.
Where do we follow, His partnership? He has said the word; I have
collaborated with Him.

#### Outstanding Work {#OutstandingWork}

The source code and schema are available at Github.com. This means that
the public can review and make updates to the original work of the
author. This aged work is not up-to-date with the industry trend, such
as cloud computing, mobile applications, decentralized ledger, nosql.
Part of the justification for this immaturity; is the need to maintain a
low entry point and capture a wide audience for its adoption.

the exact word for the King James Version (KJV) and not all versions of
the Bible; and doesn\'t take into consideration the English language
British versus American spelling, such as favour versus favor, nor the
generic word, such as, man versus men. When is this, anointing of the
Spirit ( [1 Samuel 2:26, Luke

Can you create a fictitious record in the Contact table, that meet later
fulfillment. This record in the contact table will contain a word that
is placeable in the title or company field/column. This information is
substantiable in the commentary column of the CaseBasedReasoning table.
This is compatible to Ghost city. A bit column is settable, for this
contact. It allows to keep the contact ID as a foreign key. A record to
be someone else.

The effort of the author is to share and comprehend the word of God.
What can the author provide to the other; to substantiate the work of
the author? God made man as similar to Him to see how life can be? If I
spoke the same, how am I the same? I know, I am. The love of being the
same supersedes feeling the same. Being in the spirit; is alluding to
the sufficiency of men.

## Terminology - Words and Meaning {#Terminology}

When you write a thesis, it is a paradigm work, shift in thinking, and
it should contain a terminology section. The practice of the author will
be to list existing words, and include their meanings. For technical
jargons, the author will rely on the Internet, as a definition resource.
If the author is introducing a new word, the author will explain its
meaning, but this is rare.

Database
:   The database of choice is Microsoft SQL Server. Prior to
    specializing on SQL Server, the author experienced fifth generation
    scripting languages such as dBase, R:BASE, Clipper, Access, FoxPro;
    other relational databases, like Oracle, SQL Anywhere from Watcom,
    Sybase, and Informix. When the author applies the Microsoft
    implementation of SQL, Transact-SQL and [SQL CLR or SQLCLR (SQL
    Common Language Runtime)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_CLR) the
    author risks not being vendor-agnostic.

<!-- -->

HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
:   The document that the reader is currently reading, uses rudimentary
    formatting and links. JavaScript dynamically accesses and updates
    the Document Object Model (DOM). During the first page load, the
    application retrieves the available Bible versions. Based on the
    user\'s request, the application generates the result sets,
    on-the-fly.

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
:   The web uses the HTTP network protocol; there is a limit to how many
    requests that a particular host, may handle simultaneously.

<!-- -->

HTTP Client (or Web Browser)
:   There is partiality of the author towards Mozilla\'s Firefox,
    because Mozilla is a non-profit organization, committed to web
    standards, and it was closely associated with Brendan Eich, the
    creator of JavaScript, the software is open source, and its gives us
    the opportunity to test our Microsoft implemented software in a
    non-proprietary, vendor neutral environment. For compatibility with
    standard, the author performs tests on Microsoft\'s Internet
    Explorer (MSIE), Google\'s Chrome, mobile telephones emulators and
    simulation.

<!-- -->

HTTP Server
:   The author use Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), the
    author has experience with both the Apache HTTP Server, Apache
    Tomcat Server. The author preference for IIS, includes its tight
    integration to the Windows Operating System, SQL Server and .net
    framework.

<!-- -->

Latency
:   This is the amount of time, it takes to respond to request. The use
    of AJAX, helps to decrease the duration, the length of time, it
    takes to load-up a page.

<!-- -->

Linking
:   This dissertation depends on the structural navigation links for the
    table of contents. The associative links help to drill-down to
    particular scripture reference and Bible words. The author also
    lists, outbound links, re-direct to source web references, as in the
    bibliography section. Registration with search engines is one of the
    ways to encourage incoming links.

    to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its
    performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with
    experience E (Goodfellow et al. 2016). Machine Learning takes as
    input: data and answers and derives rules (Bileschi et al. 2020).

The SQL script contains four scripture references; therefore, there are
four execution plans. Three of these execution plans, Query 1, 3 and 4,
will solely make use of the low cost clustered index primary key seek,
PK_Scripture. These three have trivial optimization levels.

Query 2 does an Index Seek on the IDX_Scripture_VerseIDSequence, since
the where clause is on the VerseIDSequence column. The
IDX_Scripture_VerseIDSequence indexes on the VerseIDSequence column; it
is not a covering index, since the Select column-list includes the
BookID, ChapterID, VerseID; therefore, the PK_Scripture is referenced as
well in a Key Lookup. Both the Index Seek and the Key Lookup have Seek
Predicates, and the Nested Loops will join the results.

[2019-10-05ArtifactDescription.html](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/2019-10-05ArtifactDescription.html)

## Background {#Background}

The author\'s country of birth, Nigeria, gained independence on,
1960-10-01, a [Biblical
generation](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=Forty%20years&logic=phrase)
before the end of the second [millennium (plural
millennia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium). There are 2570
days between 1960-10-01 and the author\'s date of birth, 1967-10-15.
Nigeria became a republic on 1963-10-01; The difference in days between
when Nigeria became a republic, 1963-10-01, and 1967-10-15; is 1475
days; 4 Biblical years, 1 month, 5 days; 4 Gregorian years, 2 weeks. The
difference in days, between the creation of Lagos State,
[1967-05-27](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_State) and the author\'s
date of birth is 141 days (4 biblical months, 21 days) (4 months, 2
weeks, 4 days).

1967-10-15 + 75 Biblical years is 2041-09-16 ([Genesis
12:4](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2012:4)).

1984-07-17 is the date of the author\'s 17th Biblical birthday ([Genesis
37:2](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2037:2)).
The date of recording this information is 2020-10-23, Epoch timestamp:
1603454400

Jesus Christ began His ministry at the age of thirty, and the estimate
is that He served for three years ([Luke
3:23](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Luke%203:23)).
The author was born on 1967-10-15 thirty-three years before the end of
the second millennium. 1967-10-15\...2000-01-01 = 11766 days (32
biblical years, 8 biblical months, 6 days) (32 years, 2 months, 2 weeks,
3 days). 1967-10-15 B.C\....1967-10-15 A.D. = 1436515 days = 47196
months = 3933 years. My thirtieth, 30th, Biblical years birthday will
occur on 1997-05-10. My thirty-third, 33rd, Biblical years birthday will
occur on 2000-04-24. Between 1967-10-15 and 1968-04-04 are 172 days (5
biblical months, 22 days) (5 months, 2 weeks, 6 days). Between
1967-10-15 and 1968-10-15 are 366 days (1 biblical year, 6 days) (1
year, 1 day). Between 1967\'s Easter Day, 1967-03-26, and 1967-10-15, is
203 days (6 biblical months, 23 days) (6 months, 2 weeks, 5 days).
Between 0032-04-06 and 1967-10-15, is 706935 days (1963 biblical years,
8 biblical months, 15 days) (1935 years, 6 months, 1 week, 1 day)
49.09270833 Biblical generations, 280.529761 weeks of years.

At the [age of
twelve](http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=twelve%20years%20old&wholeWords=false),
Jesus Christ, His father and mother, worshipped at the temple, in
Jerusalem. The author worshipped at Saint Edward\'s Catholic Church on

The Yoruba tribe speak the Yoruba language and the Yorubas are in the
South West of Nigeria. The Yorubas practice the Christians and Moslems
religions. The East of Nigeria include the Ibos who speak the Igbo
language and are mainly Catholics. The Hausas and Fulanis are in the
North of Nigeria. At the Highway 880 South Fremont Exit, the road
separates into two, the Alvarado Boulevard, West direction, and Fremont
Boulevard, East direction.

The author\'s primary languages are English, a
[Germanic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages) language;
and [Yoruba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language), a language
spoken by western Nigerians. Between the age of twenty and twenty-four,
the author developed Kowe, a word and graphic processor. Kowe is an
editor, for typing; Kowe\'s innovation, is that the typist can type
[diacritic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic) alphabets by using
the function keys combined with the alternate, control, and shift keys.
Line drawing is also possible with Kowe. Kowe will translate languages.

Between 1997 - 1998, the author pursued his Doctorate at the University
of Wollongong, New South Wales (NSW), Australia; and he visited
Villawood Detention Center, a place for illegal migrants and asylum
seekers, every Friday, as a Christian missionary. One of those migrants,
a Ghanaian, had been at the detention center for up-to six years, and he
corresponded with immigration officials, regularly. The author thought
of building a website that will allow these migrants to share their
experiences with the rest of the world. However, the Internet, was still
in its infancy, and the author\'s knowledge was lacking. Also there were
only dial-up access, at that time; and the inmates at Villawood, did not
have computer access.

Like Jacob, the author\'s biological father is the second born, and the
author is the second twin. [Option B: Facing Adversity, Building
Resilience, and Finding Joy](http://www.optionb.org/book). I lived in
Australia, Down Under, which is in the Asia-Pacific geographical region,
for seven years; we can see a demarcation, West and East Germany, North
and South Italy. Tokunbo is the author\'s biological father\'s fourth
child, and she gave birth to twins.

1.  Between 1994-1996, I completed 2 years of education at Central
    Piedmont Community College (CPCC), Charlotte, North Carolina (NC)
2.  I graduated with 3 Associate degrees in Electronics, Computers, and
    Electrical Engineering Technology from CPCC
3.  During the Summer of 1995, after completing the 1st Associate degree
    my twin sibling and I re-located to Atlanta, Georgia to live with my
    paternal uncle Niyi. Although I gained work employment at a fast
    food restaurant, I chose to return to CPCC to complete all 3
    Associate degrees
4.  Between 1996-1998, I attended the University of North Carolina,
    Charlotte (UNCC) and graduated with a degree in Electrical
    Engineering Technology - Computer Emphasis. I do not learn\...out of
    others. My twin sibling and contemporaries are educational and
    career influences. [I am a better tutor than a

        Legal (8.5 × 14 inches)
    -   I was hired at McKey Real Estate to develop a relational
        database application using R:Base 5000. My stumbling block was
        either to use the integrated development environment (IDE)
        wizard or learn from the manual
    -   In Charlotte, an African American male prospective employer
        asked me to learn the C programming language. At Central
        Corporation, I looked up to an African American male software
        engineer that came among others to install software. At Central
        Corporation, I also upgraded software developed using the C
        programming language by increasing the number of labels it
        prints for tape reels. [What do I need of a capable human
