Baptizers include {John the Baptist, disciples, Philip, Paul} (Matthew 3:14, John 3:23, Acts 9:18, Acts 16:14-15, Acts 18:8, 1 Corinthians 1:14, 1 Corinthians 1:16). Baptizeds include {Jesus Christ, Ethopian eunuch, Paul, Cornelius, Lydia, Crispus, Gaius, Stephanas} (Matthew 3:13-16, Mark 1:9, Luke 3:21, Acts 9:18, Acts 10:48, Acts 16:14-15, Acts 18:8, 1 Corinthians 1:14, 1 Corinthians 1:16). Jesus Christ is a member of the baptized set, ∈ but in one case, it is explicitly stated that Jesus Christ, Himself, did not baptize, ∉, as Jesus Christ disciples, did the baptisms (John 4:2). Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God (Psalms 2:7, John 1:18, John 3:16, John 3:18, Acts 13:33, Hebrews 1:5, Hebrews 5:5, 1 John 4:9); therefore, Jesus Christ is equal, =, to God (John 5:18). A permutation of man's sequence is God, Jesus Christ, and then the human race (1 Corinthians 15:23-29). The baptizer is probably spiritually more mature, greater than, >, the baptized (Matthew 3:14). Paul was baptized, and he subsequently baptized, the only person mentioned as belonging to both sets; therefore, Paul is a member of the intersection, ∩, of the baptizer and baptized sets (Acts 9:18, Acts 16:14-15, Acts 18:8, 1 Corinthians 1:14, 1 Corinthians 1:16).
