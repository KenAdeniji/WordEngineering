				<span datetime="2020-09-15T00:00:00">
					The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference consists of four parts;
					there are two references each to particular chapters and verses.
					The first mention is the forward verse, which the author calculates by determining the AlphabetSequenceIndex verse in the Bible.
					The second mention is the forward chapter, and this the author calculates as before, but by substituting the verse with the chapter.
					Both the backward chapter and backward verse are the corresponding, anticlockwise places.

				The Scripture table has a

				which consists of three columns; the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID columns.

				The author is undecided, if this index will be clustered or non-clustered.
			</p>
			
			<h5 id="ScriptureTableBookIDColumn">The Scripture Table's BookID Column</h5>

			<p>
				Because there are sixty-six books in the Bible, the BookID ranges between 1 and 66;
				starting from Genesis and ending at Revelation.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Scripture_BookID_Range CHECK (BookID BETWEEN 1 AND 66)</code>
				will set the range restriction.

				The BookID participates in the natural primary key; 
				and it is part of the composite index with the ChapterID and VerseID columns.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>
				ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD  CONSTRAINT [PK_Scripture] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
				(
					BookID ASC,
					ChapterID ASC,
					VerseID ASC
				)
				</code>

				The SQL statement 
				<code>ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [CK_Scripture_ChapterID_Range] CHECK  (([ChapterID]&gt;=(1) AND [ChapterID]&lt;=(150)))</code>

			<p>
				The SQL statement 
				<code>(case when BookID &lt;=(39) then 'Old' else 'New' end)</code>
				will set this computed column.
				The Testament column serves as a filter, such as, in the

			<h5 id="Scripture_ViewBookTitleColumn">The Scripture View's BookTitle Column</h5>

			<p>
				The SQL statement 
				<code>dbo.udf_BookTitle(BookID)</code>
				is for determining this computed column.
				
				As expected, there is a correlation between the BookID column, and 
				and its corresponding BookTitle column,
				it progresses from Genesis to Revelation.
				
				Because SQL does not support arrays, the author, chose to write a 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_CLR">SQL CLR</a> 
				C# function for determining the BookTitle, when passed the BookID.
				
				Although, C# supports
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design by contract</a>,
				assertions, but the author only checks BookID range validity, and return NULL, if the
				argument does not fall within this range. The author could throw exceptions,
				but the author does not know the side effect nor full ramification.
				
				Instead of writing and determining the BookTitle using C#,
				an alternative is to use a database table.
				A table with two columns, BookID and BookTitle, 
				will store and make
				<span datetime="2021-03-17T19:11:00">extractable</span>
				the sixty-six books.
			</p>	
			
			<h5 id="ScriptureTableScriptureReferenceColumn">The Scripture Table's ScriptureReference Column</h5>

			<p>
				The SQL statement 
				<code>dbo.udf_ScriptureReference(BookID, ChapterID, VerseID)</code>
				will calculate the conjecture of the BookTitle, ChapterID, and VerseID.
				
				Since this is a computed column; therefore, you can not set its 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_integrity">Entity Integrity</a>;
				if it were not; the SQL statement 
				<code>ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT uc_Scripture_ScriptureReference UNIQUE (ScriptureReference)</code> 
				will set its entity integrity.
				The distinction between raw data versus computed columns is performance, space.
				<span datetime="2020-10-06T15:05:00">
				For example the beginning book of the New Testament, the 40th book, spelling is Matthew or Mathew, double tt versus single t.
				An improvement on the current implementation is to use soundex to decipher the book title and the corresponding BookID.

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableChapterIDSequenceColumn">The Scripture Table's ChapterIDSequence Column</h5>

				The ChapterIDSequence ranges between 1 and 1189; starting from Genesis 1 and ending at Revelation 22.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					SELECT BookID, ChapterID FROM Bible..Scripture GROUP BY BookID, ChapterID ORDER BY BookID, ChapterID
				</code>
				will decide the greatest value for ChapterIDSequence.
				
				An alternative SQL statement 
				<code>
					select count(
					distinct
						cast(BookID as varchar(6))
						+ ' '
						+ cast(ChapterID as varchar(6))

				</code>
				
				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT  CK_Scripture_ChapterIDSequence_Range CHECK (ChapterIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 1189)
				</code>
				will do the range correctness.
			
				Although it is good to know the ChapterIDSequence,

			</p>	

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableVerseIDSequenceColumn">The Scripture Table's VerseIDSequence Column</h5>

			<p>
				When loading data, the author calculates the VerseIDSequence column,
				and increments it, every time, 
				the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID
				changes during the data load.
				
				There are some Bible books that have only one chapter,
				such as,
				Obadiah, Philemon, 2 John, 3 John, Jude;
				therefore, the author is careful when the choice is made to 
				increment and update the VerseIDSequence column.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					SELECT BookTitle FROM Bible..Scripture GROUP BY BookID, BookTitle HAVING MAX(ChapterID) = 1 ORDER BY BookID
				</code>
				is for listing these one chapter, Bible books.

				The VerseIDSequence ranges between 1 and 31102; starting from Genesis 1:1,
				and ending at Revelation 22:21.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Bible..Scripture
				</code>
				will decide the greatest value for VerseIDSequence,
				the total number of rows, records, in the Bible..Scripture table.
				
				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT  CK_Scripture_VerseIDSequence_Range CHECK (VerseIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 31102)
				</code>
				will do the data integrity.
			
				As said earlier, although it is good to know the VerseIDSequence, 
				but it is primarily used to decide
				the boundaries for scripture reference queries.

				The identity functionality which auto-increments,
				before inserting each row is useful,
				for ensuring this candidate primary key,
				abides by the entity integrity constraint; however,
				
				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture
					ADD CONSTRAINT AK_Scripture_VerseIDSequence UNIQUE (VerseIDSequence)   
				</code>
				is supplementary.

				will combine the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID.
			
				This is a convention for referring to Bible rows, by a unique identifier,
				which consists of the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID.
				The leading zeros are placeholders for blocks of IDs, such as,

				The

				table's, primary task, is to tell, on the words 
				that are in the Bible. Its information set include each word's first and last 
				scripture reference occurrence(s), and count of occurrence(s).
				If the word, occurs only once, then the last occurrence is set to null.
				The incentive for writing the exact module comes from 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Hunt_%28Christian_apologist%29">Dave Hunt</a>,
				who will talk of each word's specifics,
				and 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Missler">Chuck Missler</a>
				who noted that the first occurrence of the word,
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=Love&amp;wholeWords=false">love</a>
				is in
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2022:2">Genesis 22:2</a>.
				
				The exact table, is a holding area, for staging information;
				it could be argued that there is no need, to have this table,
				because it sources its information from the Scripture table, and it is available using
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">Language Integrated Query</a>.
				The reasoning of the author is that the Scripture table is static data, and it does not need
				processing, each time, there is a request.
				Speed and lower work load are the advantages of the approach of the author;
				its disadvantage is that the exact table needs re-population,
				when there is a shift to another Bible version, which the author does not project, at this time.
				If there is a need, to support another Bible version, then the 
				Exact table loading procedure needs expansion to aid,
				this flexibility.

				The SQL statement

			<h4 id="HisWord">The HisWord Table</h4>

				The HisWord table is what the author heard from the source.

				(<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Numbers%2012:6-8">Numbers 12:6-8</a>).

				In following, the Bible's New Testament convention, where there are translations of Hebrew words 
				to English

				so also, there are translations of Yoruba words to English.
			</p>

			<p>
				There have been cases when the author cannot spell and fully comprehend what he heard.
				In such cases, and not dispose of the records, the author will partly enter what
				he heard. 
				
				This impedance mismatch between what the speaker said and what the listener heard,
				rarely occurs with English words.
				But it is likely, in the author's native language, Yoruba, which exploits word combinations and phrases.
				
				The alphabets differ slightly between the English and Yoruba languages; Yoruba contains diacritic alphabets.
				
				The author requires a Yoruba dictionary and translator;
				a recent success is with the <a href="http://translate.google.com">http://translate.google.com</a> web page.
			</p>
			
			<p>	
				The HisWord table's most important column, 
				as the name suggests, is the word column,
				which is either English or Yoruba; or a mixture of both languages.
				
				The author will yield to the Holy Spirit in translating Yoruba words to English.
				
				From previous experience, this translation is not always the most right or relevant, and
				different words may contain the diacritic alphabets; therefore, introduce various meanings
				(<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=1%20Corinthians%2012:30,%201%20Corinthians%2014">1 Corinthians 12:30, 1 Corinthians 14</a>).

			<p>	
				The word column is a potential natural primary key, since duplicates are rare.
				When redundancies do occur, we may append the sequence to the word,
				to generate a unique word.
				
				We do this manually, but an 
				<a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/plsql/plsql_triggers.htm">insert trigger</a>,
				will offer automation, and will cut the risk of primary key violation,
				which leads to gaps in the identity column.
			</p>

			<p>
				The HisWord's table, commentary column, contains implicit information.
				This communication is most likely non-verbal, and it is information such as creatures
				standing or moving towards particular locations	or engaging in other visible activities.
			</p>

			<p>
				As such, from the creation account, on the first day, there is a commandment, and there
				may be an action/response.
				
				The commandment is in the word column God created light
				(

				</li>
				<li>
					From its pre-conception, JavaScript supported the var keyword.
					When the author does not precede a variable initialization with a keyword, 
					then the variable will have global scope. 
					The author averts from variable hoisting.
					Variable definition with the var keyword is re-usable.

				<li>
					For one-time definitions, such as, issuing the document.getElementById command,
					the author relies on the const keyword.
				</li>

					Methods support object orientation by offering encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
					The author uses functions when placing localizable code inside the script section of a HTML file; 
					otherwise, generalized methods are referenceable from a JavaScript library.
				</li>
				<li>
					JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, and they are passable as variables.
					This abstraction feature is rarely necessary.

					JavaScript does not make use of overloading.
					The earlier arguments array variable and the later parameter default initialization supplements.

					processing the success and error returns when using jQuery to access web services.

			<p>
				The information which the author documents in this section of the paper;
				is the Data Declaration Language (DDL) and Data Dictionary,
				which is available at
				<a 
					href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/SQLServerDataDefinitionLanguageDDL"
				>
					GitHub.com SQLServerDataDefinitionLanguageDDL Repository
				</a>
				The Data Manipulation Language (DML) is too large to fit into the
				GitHub.com repository,
				and it is intellectual property.
				For the people that have access to the database,
				this private information is available by generating the database script.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Contact is a primary entity, and it identifies the people and organizations that the
				author has a relationship with.
				These affiliations are family, friends, business, or public service links.
				Also recordable are their street, e-mail, web addresses, and telephone numbers.
				The author stores the various information exchanges with these people.
				A known date of birth, is for notification of the subject's birthday and relative age.
				To keep up with the privacy and sensitivity of this personal information,
				the author is not sharing this highly confidential data.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The relationship between a contact and its related information is one to many;
				that is a contact may have multiple addresses.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A URI is a link to a web resource that will add to the audience's knowledge.
				The author notes the address and the date, when the author became aware
				of this information.
				The content at an address is either textual, audio, video, or image?
				
				<span datetime="2021-10-01T03:43:00">
					For URIs,
					the author rarely explicitly specifies
					the entire http protocol and
					directory post-fix, /.
					An incomplete address will not validate as an input url type. 
				</span>
				
				The author only records the
				<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> 
				address' at the place of reference 
				since it is easy to associate the title with the Wikipedia address. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Exists or does not exists?
				The transact-sql exists clause is useful for checking the existence of an object and if so,
				drop the object. This is applicable prior to re-creating the object. 
				Please note that the metadata information is lost and the create or alter statement 
				supercedes this approach.
				The exists clause is also useful in queries for determining the existence of a resultset.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These classes are important asset for the anniversary triggers;
				in the Remember entries.
			</p>
				
			<h3>Database and Application Server Source Files</h3>
			<p>
				The author chose a multi-tier architecture for building the application.

				The database layer is made-up of tables, views, stored procedures, functions.
				The database tables are easily storable and movable to other storage media.
						
				The SQL Server's data definition language (DDL), now supports DateTime2, 
				and its date range extend between January 1, 1 CE through December 31, 9999 CE.
				Some dates in 
				<a href="http://www.Wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> mention these dates.
						
				The HisWord_view contains computed columns,
				which depend on entries in the HisWord table.

				The author extracts database information by building query statements.
				<br/>

				The application layer is the bridge between the user interface layer and the database layer.

				The application layer compiles into a single 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library">Dynamic-link library</a>
				(DLL), called InformationInTransit.dll.

				The application layer consists of four namespaces, namely,
				
				InformationInTransit.DataAccess,
				InformationInTransit.ProcessCode,
				InformationInTransit.ProcessLogic,
				InformationInTransit.UserInterface.
				
				What the author builds on the server; is accessible to all the clients.
				
				What is the lifetime of this code, and what neutrality does it condone?
									
				The author started out with 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase">dBASE II</a>.
				
				The lines of code for the application layer are in the C# and embedded SQL.
			</p>
				
			<h3>Client Browser Source Files</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> (.html)</li>
					<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (.js)</li>
					<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (.css)</li>
				</ul>
				
				The .HTML files will work in all browsers; that support AJAX.

				Most of the interactive web pages are reliant on JavaScript to work, 
				mainly because they use Ajax to interact with the server.
				
				Each .HTML file, performs specific task, 
				and may have a corresponding back-end associate, web service.

				The unobtrusive JavaScript file
				<a href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/IIS/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.js">9432.js</a>
				contains re-usable code that is not .HTML files specific.
				
				The .HTML files originally contained the .CSS specifications; 
				however, the author now places styling information in a single external file,
				<a href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/IIS/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.css">9432.css</a>.
				This will reduce the sizes of the .HTML files, and it helps to achieve a consistent user interface.
			</p>

			<p datetime="2021-08-15T20:56:00">
				The work of the author is interactive, and there are links to questions and answers pages.
				Most of the input entries are textual, but some are numeric, datetime, select options.
				The answers are mostly in tabular format.
			</p>

			<q cite="#bibliographyElizabethCastro2012" datetime="2021-08-24T08:24:00">
				A HTML document contains:
				<ul>
					<li>Text content: The author informs the reader by describing His word.</li>
					<li>References to other files: The author refers to external files, such as UML images.</li>
					<li>
						Markup:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Elements: The anchor tag is the most specific.

					</li>
					<li>
						Layout Rules:
						There are no layout rules, such as header nor footer.
					</li>
					<li>
						Module Rules:
						The table of content (TOC) is for page navigation

			<h3>Web Services</h3>
			<p>
				<q cite="#bibliographyFrederikBulthoff2019">
					There is standardization on the first .NET web services architecture, .ASMX.
				</q>
				(FrederikBulthoff, 2019)
				In most cases, there is a one-to-one mapping between the .HTML, .ASMX, .CS files,
				and the database relational table, Bible..Scripture.
				For simplicity and clearage of use, the .HTML and .ASMX files, support one operation.
				GetAPage.html is the workhorse for word utterances.
				GetAPage.html will send AJAX requests to multiple .ASMX files and operations. 
				GetAPage.html is a cumulation of separate .HTML files.
				All the web services files support the SOAP request format and return JSON.
				jQuery accepts the POST, HTTP verb.
				The author stringified the data he passes to the web service in the body of the message.
				Errors are unforeseen, in the rare case, the author logs errors on the back-end, 
				and display quantitative message.
				Security is lacking; this is permissible; since the author only queries information.
			</p>

			<p datetime="2021-12-18T07:52:00">
				The web service code, .asmx, file 
				is not necessary,
				does not have a place,
				when there is no server database access
				(
					<a
						href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Numbers%2019:2,%202%20Chronicles%2015:3,%20John%2015:25,%20Romans%202:12,%20Romans%203:21,%20Romans%203:28,%20Romans%207:8,%20Romans%207:9,%201%20Corinthians%209:21,%20Hebrews%209:22"

					</a>
				).	
			</p>

			<p>	
				The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) is available,
				for example, by specifying the URI,
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL">AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL</a>
				To generate a proxy code, issue the following command;
				<code>
					wsdl.exe /language:CS /namespace:InformationInTransit.ProcessLogic /out:"AlphabetSequenceWebServiceProxy.cs" http://localhost/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL
				</code>	
				The Web Services Discovery Utility (disco) command:
				<code>
					disco.exe "http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.disco"
				</code>
				will generate the companion files;
				AlphabetSequenceWebService.disco,
				AlphabetSequenceWebService.wsdl,
				and results.discomap	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A lecture of our beginning.	
				(Hafida Na ̈ım, 2016)
				The business rule is storable and processable in C#, (.cs), source files.
				The dynamic link library, (.dll), is callable from everywhere.
				GetAPage.html computes AlphabetSequence from a simple logic,
				which is easily representable everywhere.
				The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference is retrievable from the Bible, 
				using non-complex SQL query.
				The Bible word and HisWord reference, requires substantive query.
				The Bible dictionary returns dataset from the local database.
				The author can not make a business decision, to go to a web service, to retrieve what is locally resideable.

				</q> (ABB Asea Brown Boveri)
			</p>
			
			<h4>Database Design</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>The relational model is for storing information in tables.</li>
				<li>The author normalizes data using Object-relational mapping.</li>
				<li>All the databases are OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), not OLAP (Online analytical processing).</li>
				<li>Avoid deadlock occurrences by not permitting user database updates.</li>
				<li>All the transactions follow similar routes and sequences, and the author practices granularity with the locks.</li>
				<li>Database updates are through stored procedures, which recognize and avoid the potential of integrity violation.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Database Security</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>The secretive web.config file contains the database access information.</li>
				<li>The web.config file does not explicitly mention the user login name nor password.</li>
				<li>Give access rights to roles, not to specific login identities nor user names.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>Database Data Types</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>Choose matching data types between the database and application layers.</li>
				<li>Only pick varchar(max) and nvarchar(max) as the data type, when it is essential to store large data.</li>
				<li>Prefer the decimal type; when recording the amount in currency rather than using the float type.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Nullable Type</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>Consider defaulting textual data to empty string; instead of NULL.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Indexes</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>Database changes lags with indexes.</li>
				<li>The field sequence in indexes should follow the frequency of usage.</li>
				<li>When using a composite index, place a clustered non-unique index on the major column.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Naming Conventions</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>
					Overall consistency encourages lowercase keywords.
					Keywords in lowercase are mandatory in C# and JavaScript but not in SQL.
				</li>
				<li>Use Pascal casing for naming literals, such as, tables, columns, stored procedures and functions.</li>
				<li>Use Camel casing for naming parameters and local variables.</li>
			</ol>

				For Internet connections, the contributing factors include:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Propagation delay -
						The consideration is the speed of light in the medium of transport.
						On the Internet the speed varies according to the medium which may be
						(DSL, cable, fiber) in order of performance.
						The speed of light, which was presumably constant, but now, may be declining.
						The author chooses the most accessible route.
                        Typically, working within the confines of a building.
                        This research excludes other participants.
                        The environment is transplantable for other uses.
                        The route and environment impose limitations on the local host.
						The traceroute command on the Linux operating system,
						or the similar tracert or pathping commands on the Windows operating system,
						will give travel speed.
						The author will look into the last-mile tendencies of the Internet Service Providers (ISP) in the area.
						<span datetime="2022-10-30T07:29:00">
							The receive window (rwnd) of the server should be adequate, since the users do not upload videos nor images.
						</span>
					</li>
					<li>Transmission delay - The time to input the packet into the link, which is determined by the length of the packet and the data rate of the link. On the author's behalf, the Bible book ID is transmitted to the client and convertible to the title by JavaScript. Formatting is done by the client.</li>
					<li>Processing delay - The duration of processing the header, detect bit-level errors, and determine the other end. In an Intranet environment, this is done locally.</li>
					<li>Queuing delay - The processing wait time is dependent on the browser supporting multiple page tabs, and other applicatons using the network?</li>

					<li>The general Cascading Style Sheet, 9432.css file</li>

				The reason for noting this observation is that the Domain Name System (DNS)
				lookup time is low; since the author uses
				relative directory addressing as much as possible

				Statistics Terms
			</q>
			</h3>
			(Bruce et al. 2017).
			
			<h4>Key Terms for Data Types</h4>
			
			<h5>Continuous</h5>
			<p>
				The Dated column is a valid DateTime, and generally, it is ongoing, rarely does the author backdate.
			</p>

			<h5>Discrete</h5>
			<p>
				The identity columns and AlphabetSequenceIndex are integer values; 
				that fall into a small unique set.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Categorical</h5>
			<p>
				The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference is of the scripture reference type, and it is a string.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Binary</h5>
			<p>
				The Testament column is either Old or New.
			</p>

			<h5>Ordinal</h5>
			<p>
				The identity columns are all ordinal, following an ascending order.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Key Terms for Rectangular Data</h4>
			
			<h5>Data frame</h5>
			<p>
				The data storage is a relational database; other options include spreadsheet,
				comma separated value (CSV), eXtensible mark-up language (XML),
				JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format.
			</p>

			<h5>Feature</h5>
			<p>
				The most important predictor columns are the Word, Dated, and ContactID.
			</p>

			<h5>Outcome</h5>
			<p>
				The dependent columns include the AlphabetSequenceIndex, AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference
				and FromUntil date difference.
			</p>

			<h5>Records</h5>
			<p>
				A row in a spreadsheet is comparable to a database table record.

				If the research of the author is a team effort;

			</p>
			
			<p>
				The author will place non-Microsoft DLLs in the virtual directory bin sub-directory,
				and the author will refer to Microsoft DLLs in the web.config file.
			</p>

			<p>
				The web.config is generally consistent across deployment,
				the only variable is the database server name,
				and when the application and database server exists
				on the same machine,
				the connectionStrings may use Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=master;Integrated Security=SSPI. 
				This means that the author will explictly specify the database, object owner, and system object name.
				The Application pool will take care of the security.
				There are no environment variables, in use, at this time.
				The HTML files, when calling web services, will specify the full virtual directory path,
				but when appending css and JavaScript files, relative directories will suffice,
				full path directory and filename is unnecessary and an overkill.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The author standardized on Microsoft SQL Server as the relational database of choice.
				There are several alternatives in the market.
				All database interaction goes through one access point, 
				<a href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/InformationInTransit/DataAccess/DataCommand.cs">DataCommand.cs</a>,
				only this single file needs re-work if there is a database variety change.

				will issue a unique quote-of-the-day, every day;
				and a random quote, every time.
				The author program uses the release version of jQuery, which is the most up-to-date.
				The web services, such as, Sefaria.org, should not need code-revisit.
				The code in the third-party libraries, such as, Newtonsoft.Json.dll, is consistent,
				and should rarely need re-deployment.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The application is mostly stateless except for the database read.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Internet Information Server (IIS) HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
				by default runs on port 80, like other web servers, but this is modifiable.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Using the current architecture, the author takes care of concurrency and deadlocks;
				because database writes rarely occur and are short, reads are tolerant.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The threads are simple and conclusive; therefore,
				there are small start-up and short-down periods.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is unity between the development and production
				team, environment, and time frame.
				The same knowledge worker can write, deploy, and run code.

			<h4>Parent Scripts and Objects</h4>

			<p>
				GetAPage.html contains the HTML5 directive, head, and body sections.
				The head section contains the title and meta tags for search-engine optimization (SEO).
				The 3 languages that make up a web page are in the following order: CSS, HTML, JavaScript.
			</p>

			<p>
				HTML is an element's nodes.
				There are only single instances of the input and submit elements.
				There are multiple div containers for the result sets.
				Although HTML supports attributes, the ID attribute is the author's only general declaration.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Both CSS and JavaScript act on HTML tags.
				JavaScript and CSS render the contents of HTML.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are minute uses of global variables. 
				The author discourages this, because of encapsulation and debugging traceability and granularity.
			</p>

			<h4>Naming Conventions</h4>

			<p>
				JavaScript relaxes variable declarations.
				Variables do not need explicit declaration, and these declarations are redefinable.
				In spite of this, the author is judicious about variables.
				The data- attribute is user customizable.

									Function Point Analysis (FPA):
									It looks ahead and assumes the amount of work a program will require.

			<h3>Progress</h3>
			<p>
				After the author conceived the notion for AlphabetSequence,
				he stored the word spoken into XML files, along with manually
				determining the relevant Bible word.
				This, the author did, because the author thought and felt that the readers
				will prefer to read the recent information,
				and they do not have to regurgitate the entire database.
				The author was living at Newark, and working from Fremont.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The author recorded, the FromUntil Time Span, explicitly into the
				Remember's table commentary column.
				Now, there are three computed columns, managing this period(s);
				these are the days difference, the Biblical time period, and Common Era computation.
				The author is saving memory storage space this way.
				And, also offering the opportunity to other people, the
				possibility to calculate their preferred period.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Using the knowledge learnt from horizontal replication and partition,
				the audience are no longer forced to accept the author's calendar.
				The audience can choose their acceptable fact, and
				ignore nor standard derivation.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The history, this way, is to say;
				at the begining, the author will record every entry after six p.m.
				as the next day saying, just like the Jewish day starts at 6 p.m.
				With the reasoning advent, the Tanakh, the New Testament, and the Koran,
				the truth partiality, is our governance.
			</p>
			
			<h3>The Basic of Facilitating the Truth</h3>
			
			<p>
				Most words have precedence, and do not exist in an emptiness.
				Words follow a trend.
				Are their supportive collaboration, to the utterance the author hears;
				these are linkable for historical evidence.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				How do we give our actualities?
				I have found written text, the easiest and most applicable way
				of sharing thoughts.
				Words spoken, when passed from generation to generation,
				may gain legend status, and therefore, lose appropriateness.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Examine the course of history?
				You will find, that most truth, are actually realizing the dream.
				In my case, when I try to recall, the past, I search by keywords,
				numbers and dates.
				So, entries in the word, are most to realization.
				The first words spoken have higher importance and closer affinity;
				so also, prophetic application, have standard occurrence.
			</p>

			<p datetime="2020-12-26T12:04:00">
				Our work, so much depends on data entry.
				The Remember table relies on relationship, deductive reasoning.
			</p>

				In the first words, in the Bible, God referred to the beginning, of His work,

				on the activities on the earth; and God we understand, resides in the heaven,
				the last point for good on earth.
				To seek a development; it had a beginning.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the second sentence, second verse, God mentions, that the earth was
				without form and void; meaning the earth was without content.
				Nothing was a member of the earth.
				Also, God's spirit, a member of God, moved across the water.

                Department of Training Education Committee (DTEC),
                so I had an understanding of integrating and skilling re-locating workers
                I tried to share computer books, but inmates were undaunted by their relevance to their misery.
                They were expected to write letters to immigration officials.
                This influenced my desire to practice authoring Christian literature and improve my communication.
                How could I relate to less fortunate people?
                How may I be the one giving?
                How can I let the Holy Spirit partake on my side?
                What are these roles for, and how will I be a mediator?
                What do I share as a bargain?
                All these are words to say. What do I mean as a human being?
                Where does the spirit hold its own?
                Computers are programmable, humans are useful. Where does a side take the rest?
                What I am finding out, is how necessary I am as a person?
                How do I do my part in participating?
                What can you take from me, and make as your own?
                My words may not be what you will say, but how can your experience let you say?
                Imagine your life will be lived, as you say.
                When the times, programming lines, lines of code, play out a scenario.
                So words make meaning as sufficiency.
                Whose life have I lived to complexity?
                To the full of His deed
                (
                    <a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=John%2015:24">John 15:24</a>
                )?
                What can His prove relate to me?

			<p datetime="2021-06-07T21:09:00">
				It is firstly, a database work.
				That is the author records God's word.
				What the author hears, he relates to the Bible and the other scriptural sources.
				These information are all in database tables,
				giving the author the luxury of using relational technology.
				The benefit includes storage and archive,
				that is, the work is usable in tabular format.
				There is a copy of the information running Microsoft SQL Server on a Linux operating system;
				which the author switches to, by changing the database connection string of one node in the web.config.
				When the user decides to stabilize and admit no further changes;
				then there is no need to do additional database update work.
				As with such work, the database schema remains consistent, since the beginning.
				The choice of word, meets today's expectations.
				The addition of the ActToGod table, demonstrates the maturity of the author.
			</p>			
			
			<p>	
				The author, first wrote his history, in multiple stand-alone files .HTML, .XML.
				(<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Acts%207:22">Acts 7:22</a>).
				This documentation didn't allow for enough dating,
				to track creation and change, nor easy querying.
				Therefore, the decision to move to a relational database;
				that will augment this fact.
			</p>

			<p datetime="2021-07-05T10:10:00">
				Since the beginning, the author wrote a ContactMaintenance.aspx
				server-side page as a user-interface (UI) to record contact information.
				This page remains active, till today.
			</p>

			<p datetime="2021-07-05T10:10:00">
				The author uses Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
				to document general information.
				When the author is offsite, text editors provides a place to 
				scribble data manipulation language (DML)
				statements into SQL script files, for later execution.
				Please understand that both means mentioned above
				do not always support the checking of spellings nor grammar,
				and have limited formatting.

				I have a product; where is the method?
			</p>
			
			<p datetime="2021-06-07T06:42:00">
				Adoptability: 
				<ol>
					<li>
						What is the minimum requirement?
						The author believes it is the
						Holy Spirit spreading the Word,
						and it is not him, making up the word.
						As long as you have the spirit of God,
						then you are receptive to this information sharing.
						The word is not always clearly heard,
						and the sighting is not always 20/20 visibile.
					</li>
					<li>
						What is the literacy level requirement?
						If you know the alphabets arrangements,
						then you can determine the AlphabetSequenceIndex by hand.
						To determine the AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference,
						you need to know, the count of chapters and verses.
						This manual work gives way to computation,
						which is not error prone.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Biblical account wrote dreams and visions textually,
						without resorting to the database.
						Search Engines Crawlers parse the standard HTML files and rarely query the database.
						The calendar: years, months, days,
						may benefit from the stipulation and generability of the Common Era.
					</li>
					<li>
						Where is the world leading and how do we follow it?
						The author fiddles with the idea of
						bringing technology to the Word of God.
						The author is unaware of the start and early beginnings
						of dictionaries, concordance and commentaries;
						but the author gains from this works as a reference.
						The widely acception of a work, accompanies preference and prevalence.
					</li>
					<li>
						The result of the Bible, is how we use it.
						The emphasises of Jesus Christ and apostle Paul is the word for today?
						As the author sees from the Bible,
						Moses assigned intervention to leaders, and Moses went to God as a higher authority.
						Who is the work for? Who can benefit from reading this work?

			<h3>To Whom Masculine?</h3>

			<p>
				How the Bible compares the gender?
			</p>
			
			<h4>Man, after his Fall</h4>
			<p>
				During Creation, God asked all living things, be fruitful and multiply;
				God asked Adam to name the living creatures,
				and God required Adam to take care of the Garden of Eden,
				but this taking care is to dress and keep the garden;
				there is a role for man, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and the tree of life.
				God did not specify the welfare of animals.
				Out of Adam, God made a helper for Adam, Eve.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the Fall of Man, Adam's labor will be thorough;
				and there is enmity between the serpent and Eve, and each other's seed;
				and Eve will have pain, during child-birth.
			</p>
			<p>
				God made coats of skins, and clothed them; it is our presumption, 
				that the clothing is from living things, generally perceived as sin sacrificial animal(s),
				but since this clothing is not specified, an alternative, is that it is a plant, or another creature entirely.
			</p>
			<p>
				God created an adult male, Adam; and his female counterpart, Eve
				(
					<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Deuteronomy%202:14,%20John%205:5">Deuteronomy 2:14, John 5:5</a>
				).
				There is no mention of Adam's activity, after the fall of man;
				as Eve bares and name their children; Adam's earlier effort, 
				which was to cater for the Garden of Eden and name the animals.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Man at Birth</h4>
			<p>
				We can only suggest, that the struggle between good and evil,
				continues upon the birth of Cain, Abel, and Seth.
				Eve named Cain, as her possession; and Seth, as the appointed seed.
			</p>
			<p>
				God instituted male circumcision, which should take place on the eighth day,
				as man's responsibility in keeping the Abrahamic covenant.
			</p>
			<p>
				At times, there is proclamation of a mantle, before livelihood;
				as in the case of Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Samson, John the Baptist, and Jesus Christ.
				In each example, there is a relationship between God and a parent;
				and God is directing, the offspring's onus.
				The want similar to Christ; is to see yourself, among fold.
			</p>

			<h4>Man's Task</h4>
			<p>
				Historical man's profession are keeper of sheep, a tiller of the ground,
				handle the harp and organ, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron.
				Unlike the first men, in the Bible, Seth's service was not identified,
				we only know that after the birth of Seth's son, Enos,
				men began to call, on the name of the LORD.
			</p>
			<p>
				The 10 Commandments details the relationship we aspire to have with God,
				and our fellow-men.
			</p>
			<p>
				God may consign men to overseer, as in the case of
				Melchizedek king of Salem, the priest of the most high God, and collector of tithes;
				Joseph, dreamer and interpreter, and he will save much life, in Egypt;
				as in incorporating the end.

			<h2 id="Terminology">Terminology - Words and Meaning</h2>
			<p>
				When you write a thesis, it is a paradigm work, shift in thinking, 
				and it should contain a terminology section.
				The practice of the author will be to list existing words, and include their meanings.
				For technical jargons, the author will rely on the Internet, as a definition resource.
				If the author is introducing a new word, the author will explain its meaning, but this is rare.

				<dt>Database</dt>
				<dd>
					The database of choice is Microsoft SQL Server.
					Prior to specializing on SQL Server, the author experienced
					fifth generation scripting languages such as dBase, R:BASE, Clipper, Access, FoxPro;
					other relational databases, like Oracle, SQL Anywhere from Watcom, Sybase, and Informix.
					When the author applies the Microsoft implementation of SQL,
					Transact-SQL and 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_CLR">SQL CLR or SQLCLR (SQL Common Language Runtime)</a>
					the author risks not being vendor-agnostic.
				</dd>

			<dl>
				<dt>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</dt>
				<dd>
					The document that the reader is currently reading, uses rudimentary formatting and links.
					JavaScript dynamically accesses and updates the Document Object Model (DOM).
					During the first page load, the application retrieves the available Bible versions.
					Based on the user's request, the application generates the result sets, on-the-fly.

			<dl>
				<dt>HTTP Client (or Web Browser)</dt>
				<dd>
					There is partiality of the author towards Mozilla's Firefox,
					because Mozilla is a non-profit organization,
					committed to web standards,  
					and it was closely associated with Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript,
					the software is open source,
					and its gives us the opportunity to test our Microsoft implemented software
					in a non-proprietary, vendor neutral environment.
					For compatibility with standard, the author performs tests on 
					Microsoft's Internet Explorer (MSIE), Google's Chrome, mobile telephones emulators and simulation.

			<dl>
				<dt>HTTP Server</dt>
				<dd>
					The author use Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), the author has experience with both the Apache HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat Server.

				<dt>Latency</dt>
				<dd>
					This is the amount of time, it takes to respond to request.

			<dl>
				<dt>Linking</dt>
				<dd>
					This dissertation depends on the structural navigation links for the table of contents.
					The associative links help to drill-down to particular scripture reference and Bible words.
					The author also lists, outbound links, re-direct to source web references, as in the bibliography section.
					Registration with search engines is one of the ways to encourage incoming links.

					The SQL script contains four scripture references;
					therefore, there are four execution plans.
					Three of these execution plans,
					Query 1, 3 and 4,
					will solely 
					make use of the low cost clustered index primary key seek,
					PK_Scripture.
					These three have trivial optimization levels.
				</p>
				<p>
					Query 2 does an Index Seek on the IDX_Scripture_VerseIDSequence,
					since the where clause is on the VerseIDSequence column.
					The IDX_Scripture_VerseIDSequence indexes on the VerseIDSequence column;
					it is not a covering index, since the Select column-list
					includes the BookID, ChapterID, VerseID; therefore,
					the PK_Scripture is referenced as well in a Key Lookup.
					Both the Index Seek and the Key Lookup have Seek Predicates, and the Nested Loops will join the results.
