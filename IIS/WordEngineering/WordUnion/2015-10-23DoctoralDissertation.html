				The ChapterID ranges between 1 and 150; 
				the SQL statement

			<p>
				The SQL statement 
<pre><code>
(case when BookID &lt;=(39) then 'Old' else 'New' end)
</code></pre>
				will set this computed column.
				The Testament column serves as a filter, such as, in the

			<h5 id="Scripture_ViewBookTitleColumn">The Scripture View's BookTitle Column</h5>

			<p>
				The SQL statement 
<pre><code>
dbo.udf_BookTitle(BookID)
</code></pre>
				It is for determining this computed column.
				As expected, there is a correlation between the BookID column, and its corresponding BookTitle column; it progresses from Genesis to Revelation.
				Because SQL does not support arrays, the author chose to write an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_CLR">SQL CLR</a> C# function for determining the BookTitle when passed the BookID.
				Although C# supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design by contract</a> assertions, the author only checks BookID range validity, and returns NULL, if the argument does not fall within this range. 
				The author could throw exceptions, but the author does not know the side effects nor the full ramifications.
				Instead of writing and determining the book title using C#, an alternative is to use a database table.
				A table with two columns, BookID and BookTitle, will store and make 
				<span data-Dated="2021-03-17T19:11:00">extractable</span>
				the sixty-six books. 
				<span data-Dated="2020-10-06T15:05:00">
					For example, the first book of the New Testament, the 40th book, spelling is Matthew or Mathew, double tt versus (VS) single t.
					An improvement on the current implementation is to use soundex to decipher the book title and the corresponding BookID.

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableScriptureReferenceColumn">The Scripture Table's ScriptureReference Column</h5>

			<p>
				The SQL statement 
<pre><code>

				Will calculate the conjecture of the BookTitle, ChapterID, and VerseID.
				Since this is a computed column, therefore, the author is not able to set its
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_integrity">Entity Integrity</a>;
				if it were not the SQL statement 
				<pre><code>ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT uc_Scripture_ScriptureReference UNIQUE (ScriptureReference)</code></pre>

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableChapterIDSequenceColumn">The Scripture Table's ChapterIDSequence Column</h5>

				When loading data, the author decides the ChapterIDSequence column, and increments it when the BookID and ChapterID, change during loading.
				The ChapterIDSequence ranges between 1 and 1189, starting in Genesis 1 and ending at Revelation 22.
				The SQL statement 
<pre><code>
SELECT BookID, ChapterID FROM Bible..Scripture GROUP BY BookID, ChapterID ORDER BY BookID, ChapterID
</code></pre> 
				will decide the greatest value for ChapterIDSequence.
				An alternative SQL statement 
<pre><code>
select count(
distinct
	cast(BookID as varchar(6))
	+ ' '
	+ cast(ChapterID as varchar(6))
)

	, ChapterID
)
as
(
	select distinct BookID, ChapterID
	FROM	Bible..Scripture
)
select cnt = count(*)
from   cte
</code></pre>
				The SQL statement 
<pre><code>
ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Scripture_ChapterIDSequence_Range CHECK (ChapterIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 1189)
</code></pre> 
				will check the range correctness.
				Although it is good to know the ChapterIDSequence, but it is primarily used to decide the boundaries for scripture reference queries.
			</p>	

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableVerseIDSequenceColumn">The Scripture Table's VerseIDSequence Column</h5>

			<p>
				When loading data, the author calculates the VerseIDSequence column,
				and increments it, every time, 
				the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID
				changes during the data load.
				
				There are some Bible books that have only one chapter,
				such as,
				Obadiah, Philemon, 2 John, 3 John, Jude;
				therefore, the author is careful when the choice is made to 
				increment and update the VerseIDSequence column.

				The SQL statement 
<pre><code>
SELECT BookTitle FROM Bible..Scripture GROUP BY BookID, BookTitle HAVING MAX(ChapterID) = 1 ORDER BY BookID
</code></pre>
				is for listing these one chapter, Bible books.

				The VerseIDSequence ranges between 1 and 31102; starting from Genesis 1:1,
				and ending at Revelation 22:21.

				The SQL statement 
<pre><code>
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Bible..Scripture
</code></pre>
				will decide the greatest value for VerseIDSequence,
				the total number of rows, records, in the Bible..Scripture table.
				
				The SQL statement 
<pre><code>
ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT  CK_Scripture_VerseIDSequence_Range CHECK (VerseIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 31102)
</code></pre>
				will do the data integrity.
			
				As said earlier, although it is good to know the VerseIDSequence, 
				but it is primarily used to decide
				the boundaries for scripture reference queries.

				The identity functionality which auto-increments,
				before inserting each row is useful,
				for ensuring this candidate primary key,
				abides by the entity integrity constraint; however,
				
				The SQL statement 
<pre><code>
ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture
ADD CONSTRAINT AK_Scripture_VerseIDSequence UNIQUE (VerseIDSequence)   
</code></pre>
				is supplementary.

</code></pre>
				will combine the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID.
			
				This is a convention for referring to Bible rows, by a unique identifier,
				which consists of the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID.
				The leading zeros are placeholders for blocks of IDs, such as,
				BookID which will have two digits,

				The

				table's, primary task, is to tell, on the words 
				that are in the Bible. Its information set include each word's first and last 
				scripture reference occurrence(s), and count of occurrence(s).
				If the word, occurs only once, then the last occurrence is set to null.
				The incentive for writing the exact module comes from 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Hunt_%28Christian_apologist%29">Dave Hunt</a>,
				who will talk of each word's specifics,
				and 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Missler">Chuck Missler</a>
				who noted that the first occurrence of the word,
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=Love&amp;wholeWords=false">love</a>
				is in
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2022:2">Genesis 22:2</a>.
				
				The exact table, is a holding area, for staging information;
				it could be argued that there is no need, to have this table,
				because it sources its information from the Scripture table, and it is available using
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">Language Integrated Query</a>.
				The reasoning of the author is that the Scripture table is static data, and it does not need
				processing, each time, there is a request.
				Speed and lower work load are the advantages of the approach of the author;
				its disadvantage is that the exact table needs re-population,
				when there is a shift to another Bible version, which the author does not project, at this time.
				If there is a need, to support another Bible version, then the 
				Exact table loading procedure needs expansion to aid,
				this flexibility.
				
				The

				The SQL statement

			<p>
				There have been cases when the author cannot spell and fully comprehend what he heard.
				In such cases, and not dispose of the records, the author will partly enter what

				This impedance mismatch between what the speaker said and what the listener heard,
				rarely occurs with English words.
				But it is likely, in the author's native language, Yoruba, which exploits word combinations and phrases.
				
				The alphabets differ slightly between the English and Yoruba languages; Yoruba contains diacritic alphabets.

			<ul>
				<li>
					JavaScript supports three keywords for declaring variables.
					These are the var, let, const keywords.
				</li>
				<li>
					From its pre-conception, JavaScript supported the var keyword.
					When the author does not precede a variable initialization with a keyword, 
					then the variable will have global scope. 
					The author averts from variable hoisting.
					Variable definition with the var keyword is re-usable.
					The strict mode is a later addition to JavaScript that helps in enforcing variable rules.
				</li>
				<li>
					For one-time definitions, such as, issuing the document.getElementById command,
					the author relies on the const keyword.
				</li>
				<li>
					Unlike some typed languages, 
					JavaScript does not support explicitly specifying the type of a variable.
				</li>
				<li>JavaScript string comparisons are by default case-sensitive.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 data-Dated="2021-12-05T17:51:00">Functions and Methods</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					Methods are functions that are referrable from a class.
					Methods support object orientation by offering encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
					The author uses functions when placing localizable code inside the script section of a HTML file; 
					otherwise, generalized methods are referenceable from a JavaScript library.
				</li>
				<li>
					JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, and they are passable as variables.
					This abstraction feature is rarely necessary.
				</li>
				<li>
					JavaScript does not support method overloading.
					The earlier arguments array variable and the later parameter default initialization supplements.
				</li>
				<li>
					The author consistently uses anonymous functions for
					processing the success and error returns when using jQuery to access web services.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3 data-Dated="2021-12-06T15:21:00">Conditions</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					The author emulates the Microsoft ASP.NET Page.IsPostBack property check, and when it is not so,
					parse the query arguments; otherwise, skip the parsing and proceed to page submittion. 					
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 data-Dated="2021-12-07T03:13:00">Arrays and Loops</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					For displaying the Bible book titles, the 66 books are in a JavaScript iterable array.
					This reduces the data load from the server to client, and it offers spelling flexibility. 
					The select options resemble similar customization.
				</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3 data-Dated="2021-12-07T11:37:00">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) Document</h3>

					The DOCTYPE is the first declaration in an HTML document,
					and it is the conformation standard specification.
				</li>
				<li>The html tag is the root and the container for all the other tags.</li>
				<li>
					The head tag contains the title and the meta tags for the search engine optimization (SEO).

			<h4>Structured and Unstructured</h4>
			
			<p>
				Structured data is alphanumeric put in row-column.
				Unstructured data is either text, image, audio, or video.
				This research is mainly structured data.
			</p>

			<h4>Standard</h4>
			
			<p>
				The author imports complete, not NULL nor empty data, such as the Bible and the dictionaries.
			</p>

			<p>
				The author achieves data validity by constraining 
				and restricting inputs.
				Since this is not a commercial work, 
				Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are not vital.
			</p>

			<p>
				The author references and is not tampering with authoritative Bible work;
				this helps to make sure correctness - accuracy, consistency, integrity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Timeliness is effectual in the single user data entry table, HisWord.
			</p>

			<h3>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</h3>
			<h4>Class</h4>
			
			<p>
				The information which the author documents in this section of the paper;
				is the Data Declaration Language (DDL) and Data Dictionary,
				which is available at
				<a 
					href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/SQLServerDataDefinitionLanguageDDL"
				>
					GitHub.com SQLServerDataDefinitionLanguageDDL Repository
				</a>
				The Data Manipulation Language (DML) is too large to fit into the
				GitHub.com repository,
				and it is intellectual property.
				For the people that have access to the database,
				this private information is available by generating the database script.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Contact is a primary entity, and it identifies the people and organizations that the
				author has a relationship with.
				These affiliations are family, friends, business, or public service links.
				Also recordable are their street, e-mail, web addresses, and telephone numbers.
				The author stores the various information exchanges with these people.
				A known date of birth, is for notification of the subject's birthday and relative age.
				To keep up with the privacy and sensitivity of this personal information,
				the author is not sharing this highly confidential data.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The relationship between a contact and its related information is one-to-many;
				that is a contact may have multiple addresses.
				The other 2 types of relationships are one-to-one, and many-to-many.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A URI is a link to a web resource that will add to the audience's knowledge.
				The author notes the address and the date, when the author became aware
				of this information.
				The content at an address is either textual, audio, video, or image?
				
				<span data-Dated="2021-10-01T03:43:00">
					For URIs,
					the author rarely explicitly specifies
					the entire http protocol and
					directory post-fix, /.
					An incomplete address will not validate as an input url type. 
				</span>
				
				The author only records the
				<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> 
				address' at the place of reference 
				since it is easy to associate the title with the Wikipedia address. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Exists or does not exists?
				The transact-sql exists clause is useful for checking the existence of an object and if so,
				drop the object. This is applicable prior to re-creating the object. 
				Please note that the metadata information is lost and the create or alter statement 
				supercedes this approach.
				The exists clause is also useful in queries for determining the existence of a resultset.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These classes are important asset for the anniversary triggers;
				in the Remember entries.
			</p>
				
			<h3>Database and Application Server Source Files</h3>
			<p>
				The author chose a multi-tier architecture for building the application.

				The database layer is made-up of tables, views, stored procedures, functions.
				The database tables are easily storable and movable to other storage media.
						
				The SQL Server's data definition language (DDL), now supports DateTime2, 
				and its date range extend between January 1, 1 CE through December 31, 9999 CE.
				Some dates in 
				<a href="http://www.Wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> mention these dates.
						
				The HisWord_view contains computed columns,
				which depend on entries in the HisWord table.

				The author extracts database information by building query statements.
				<br>

				The application layer is the bridge between the user interface layer and the database layer.

				The application layer compiles into a single 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library">Dynamic-link library</a>
				(DLL), called InformationInTransit.dll.

				The application layer consists of four namespaces, namely,
				
				InformationInTransit.DataAccess,
				InformationInTransit.ProcessCode,
				InformationInTransit.ProcessLogic,
				InformationInTransit.UserInterface.
				
				What the author builds on the server; is accessible to all the clients.
				
				What is the lifetime of this code, and what neutrality does it condone?
									
				The author started out with 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase">dBASE II</a>.
				
				The lines of code for the application layer are in the C# and embedded SQL.
			</p>
				
			<h3>Client Browser Source Files</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> (.html)</li>
				<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (.js)</li>
				<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (.css)</li>
			</ul>
				
			<p>
				The .HTML files will work in all browsers; that support AJAX.

				Most of the interactive web pages are reliant on JavaScript to work, 
				mainly because they use Ajax to interact with the server.
				
				Each .HTML file, performs specific task, 
				and may have a corresponding back-end associate, web service.

				The unobtrusive JavaScript file
				<a href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/IIS/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.js">9432.js</a>
				contains re-usable code that is not .HTML files specific.
				
				The .HTML files originally contained the .CSS specifications; 
				however, the author now places styling information in a single external file,
				<a href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/IIS/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.css">9432.css</a>.
				This will reduce the sizes of the .HTML files, and it helps to achieve a consistent user interface.
			</p>
			
			<p data-Dated="2021-08-15T20:56:00">
				The work of the author is interactive, and there are links to questions and answers pages.
				Most of the input entries are textual, but some are numeric, datetime, select options.
				The answers are mostly in tabular format.

			<h3>Web Services</h3>
			<div>
				<blockquote cite="#bibliographyFrederikBulthoff2019">
					There is standardization on the first .NET web services architecture, .ASMX.
				</blockquote>
				(FrederikBulthoff, 2019)
				In most cases, there is a one-to-one mapping between the .HTML, .ASMX, .CS files,
				and the database relational table, Bible..Scripture.
				For simplicity and clearage of use, the .HTML and .ASMX files, support one operation.
				GetAPage.html is the workhorse for word utterances.
				GetAPage.html will send AJAX requests to multiple .ASMX files and operations. 
				GetAPage.html is a cumulation of separate .HTML files.
				All the web services files support the SOAP request format and return JSON.
				jQuery accepts the POST, HTTP verb.
				The author stringified the data he passes to the web service in the body of the message.
				Errors are unforeseen, in the rare case, the author logs errors on the back-end, 
				and display quantitative message.
				Security is lacking; this is permissible; since the author only queries information.
			</div>

			<p data-Dated="2021-12-18T07:52:00">
				The web service code, .asmx, file 
				is not necessary,
				does not have a place,
				when there is no server database access
				(
					<a
						href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Numbers%2019:2,%202%20Chronicles%2015:3,%20John%2015:25,%20Romans%202:12,%20Romans%203:21,%20Romans%203:28,%20Romans%207:8,%20Romans%207:9,%201%20Corinthians%209:21,%20Hebrews%209:22"

					</a>
				).	
			</p>

			<p>	
				The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) is available,
				for example, by specifying the URI,
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL">AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL</a>
				To generate a proxy code, issue the following command;
				<code>
					wsdl.exe /language:CS /namespace:InformationInTransit.ProcessLogic /out:"AlphabetSequenceWebServiceProxy.cs" http://localhost/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL
				</code>	
				The Web Services Discovery Utility (disco) command:
				<code>
					disco.exe "http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.disco"
				</code>
				will generate the companion files;
				AlphabetSequenceWebService.disco,
				AlphabetSequenceWebService.wsdl,
				and results.discomap	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A lecture of our beginning.	
				(Hafida Na ̈ım, 2016)
				The business rule is storable and processable in C#, (.cs), source files.
				The dynamic link library, (.dll), is callable from everywhere.
				GetAPage.html computes AlphabetSequence from a simple logic,
				which is easily representable everywhere.
				The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference is retrievable from the Bible, 
				using non-complex SQL query.
				The BibleWord and HisWord reference, requires substantive query.
				The Bible dictionary returns dataset from the local database.
				The author can not make a business decision, to go to a web service, to retrieve what is locally resideable.

			<h3>Database Standard</h3>
			
			<h4>Database Design</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>The relational model is for storing information in tables.</li>
				<li>The author normalizes data using Object-relational mapping.</li>
				<li>All the databases are OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), not OLAP (Online analytical processing).</li>
				<li>Avoid deadlock occurrences by not permitting user database updates.</li>
				<li>All the transactions follow similar routes and sequences, and the author practices granularity with the locks.</li>
				<li>Database updates are through stored procedures, which recognize and avoid the potential of integrity violation.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Database Security</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>The secretive web.config file contains the database access information.</li>
				<li>The web.config file does not explicitly mention the user login name nor password.</li>
				<li>Give access rights to roles, not to specific login identities nor user names.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>Database Data Types</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>Choose matching data types between the database and application layers.</li>
				<li>Only pick varchar(max) and nvarchar(max) as the data type, when it is essential to store large data.</li>
				<li>Prefer the decimal type; when recording the amount in currency rather than using the float type.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Nullable Type</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>Consider defaulting textual data to empty string; instead of NULL.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Indexes</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>Database changes lags with indexes.</li>
				<li>The field sequence in indexes should follow the frequency of usage.</li>
				<li>When using a composite index, place a clustered non-unique index on the major column.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Naming Conventions</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>
					Overall, consistency encourages lowercase keywords.
					Keywords in lowercase are mandatory in case-sensitive programming languages like C# and JavaScript, but not in SQL.
				</li>
				<li>Use Pascal casing for naming literals, such as, tables, columns, stored procedures and functions.</li>
				<li>Use Camel casing for naming parameters and local variables.</li>
			</ol>

						Propagation delay -
						The consideration is the speed of light in the medium of transport.
						On the Internet the speed varies according to the medium which may be

						The speed of light, which was presumably constant, but now, may be declining.
						The author chooses the most accessible route.

				and a random quote, every time.
				The author program uses the release version of jQuery, which is the most up-to-date.
				The web services, such as, Sefaria.org, should not need code-revisit.
				The code in the third-party libraries, such as, Newtonsoft.Json.dll, is consistent,
				and should rarely need re-deployment.

			<p>
				The application is mostly stateless except for the database read.

			<p>
				Internet Information Server (IIS) HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

				because database writes rarely occur and are short, reads are tolerant.

				The threads are simple and conclusive; therefore,
				there are small start-up and short-down periods.

				The head section contains the title and meta tags for search-engine optimization (SEO).
				The 3 languages that make up a web page are in the following ascending order: CSS, HTML, JavaScript.
			</p>

				HTML is an element's nodes.

				Although HTML supports attributes, the ID attribute is the author's only general declaration.

				There are minute uses of global variables. 
				The author discourages this, because of encapsulation and debugging traceability and granularity.

They began to break and eat the given chocolate bar. Towards the door to our west, I saw some young females coming inside. I admired a slender female who was wearing tight-fitting white trousers. At the intersection of Fremont Boulevard and Paseo Padre Parkway, I saw a van that was painted across with the color of the United States of America (USA) flag, red, white, and blue, but the red color looked like orange. There were young Asian females running from the center-west, upper, and turning towards the south-west. There were cars moving and crossing the Paseo Padre Road from Fremont Boulevard, east, that almost had accidents with the young Asian female runners.

					Not to explain the Bible, but give an understanding of scripture.
					I found out at PowerSoft that my software engineering skills were not fully developed during my Master's degree programme at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS).
					It may be that I did understand the paradigm shift, client/server, or specifically, PowerBuilder? Master-slave lacking.

				On the client, HTML is content, CSS is presentation, and JavaScript is behavior.
				Both ASPX and ASMX are server-side logic.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The application tier is in a dynamic link library (DLL), and it is separable into
				client, database, and application logics, but with the advent of 
				language integrated query (Linq),
				this delineation is slowly diminishing.
				Linq rivals previous division of labor.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The database consists of tables, views, indexes, constraints, stored procedures
				and functions. These programming logic may be SQL or SQLCLR.
				SQL critics complain that while the rest of software development
				have progressed, we still use an archaic language;
				NoSQL is a challenger.

				The client is accessible from the browser, both the user interface and the source code,

				The alternative is XML.
				The preference for JSON, is because of its lighter payload.
				Another difference, in the result set, 
				the author chooses if to return a dataset, datatable, or scalar?
				The datatable is useful for a singular resultset.
				With SQL Query select statements,
				the column list may refer to *, for returning all the columns,
				in the order they are arranged in the container, table or view;
				or otherwise the stricter, specification of each column to return.
				The author restricts which rows to return,
				by issuing the conditional where clause;
				the top 1 select clause is useful, for quote of the day;
				as it supercedes the set rowcount 1, limitation.
				The author depends on the database order by clause,
				for sorting in ascending or descending order,
				Data is also rankable by clicking on the table's column header.

			<h3>Progress</h3>
			<p>
				After the author conceived the notion for AlphabetSequence,
				he stored the word spoken into XML files, along with manually
				determining the relevant Bible word.
				This, the author did, because the author thought and felt that the readers
				will prefer to read the recent information,
				and they do not have to regurgitate the entire database.
				The author was living at Newark, and working from Fremont.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The author recorded, the FromUntil Time Span, explicitly into the
				Remember's table commentary column.
				Now, there are three computed columns, managing this period(s);
				these are the days difference, the Biblical time period, and Common Era computation.
				The author is saving memory storage space this way.
				And, also offering the opportunity to other people, the
				possibility to calculate their preferred period.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Using the knowledge learnt from horizontal replication and partition,
				the audience are no longer forced to accept the author's calendar.
				The audience can choose their acceptable fact, and
				ignore nor standard derivation.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The history, this way, is to say;
				at the begining, the author will record every entry after six p.m.
				as the next day saying, just like the Jewish day starts at 6 p.m.
				With the reasoning advent, the Tanakh, the New Testament, and the Koran,
				the truth partiality, is our governance.
			</p>
			
			<h3>The Basic of Facilitating the Truth</h3>
			
			<p>
				Most words have precedence, and do not exist in an emptiness.
				Words follow a trend.
				Are their supportive collaboration, to the utterance the author hears;
				these are linkable for historical evidence.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				How do we give our actualities?
				I have found written text, the easiest and most applicable way
				of sharing thoughts.
				Words spoken, when passed from generation to generation,
				may gain legend status, and therefore, lose appropriateness.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Examine the course of history?
				You will find, that most truth, are actually realizing the dream.
				In my case, when I try to recall, the past, I search by keywords,
				numbers and dates.
				So, entries in the word, are most to realization.
				The first words spoken have higher importance and closer affinity;
				so also, prophetic application, have standard occurrence.
			</p>

			<p data-Dated="2020-12-26T12:04:00">
				Our work, so much depends on data entry.
				The Remember table relies on relationship, deductive reasoning.
			</p>

			<h3>Can we look back at history, as we precede our future</h3>

			<h4>
				An angel said to prophet Daniel, many shall run to and fro

				)
			</h4>	
			<p>	
				Is this phenomenal traceable, Biblically,
				and can we name a person that bears similar resemblance?
				When we study, king David, we can see that David fled from king Saul, his predecessor;
				and two of his biological immediate sons, who purported, to overthrow him as king.
				In the Book of Revelation, the only three mentions of king David, talk of movement

			<h3>Wanting a Member of...</h3>
				
			<p>
				In the first words, in the Bible, God referred to the beginning, of His work,
				giving time, an annotation.
				God also mentioned two places, heaven and earth, creation generally centers
				on the activities on the earth; and God we understand, resides in the heaven,
				the last point for good on earth.
				To seek a development; it had a beginning.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the second sentence, second verse, God mentions, that the earth was
				without form and void; meaning the earth was without content.
				Nothing was a member of the earth.
				Also, God's spirit, a member of God, moved across the water.
			</p>

			<p>
				When time is maximal used; time is ideal allowed.
				When our association to follow; is association to the end.

				In Australia, I got involved with the prison ministry at the Villawood Detention Center.
                The Christian missionaries that were serving felt that fellow migrants might aid in responding to new applicants.
                I was deported to my country of origin, Nigeria, from the United States of America (USA);
                therefore, I could share the plight of these inmates.
                I was also in the court process, so I could better understand Australia's law.
                Finally, my most productive contract consulting was at the
                Department of Training Education Committee (DTEC),
                so I had an understanding of integrating and skilling re-locating workers.
                I tried to share computer books, but inmates were undaunted by their relevance to their misery.
                They were expected to write letters to immigration officials.
                This influenced my desire to practice authoring Christian literature and improve my communication.
                How could I relate to less fortunate people?
                How may I be the one giving?
                How can I let the Holy Spirit partake on my side?
                What are these roles for, and how will I be a mediator?
                What do I share as a bargain?
                All these are words to say. What do I mean as a human being?
                Where does the spirit hold its own?
                Computers are programmable, humans are useful. Where does a side take the rest?
                What I am finding out, is how necessary I am as a person?
                How do I do my part in participating?
                What can you take from me, and make as your own?
                My words may not be what you will say, but how can your experience let you say?
                Imagine your life will be lived, as you say.
                When the times, programming lines, lines of code, play out a scenario.
                So words make meaning as sufficiency.
                Whose life have I lived to complexity?

				It is firstly, a database work.
				That is the author records God's word.
				What the author hears, he relates to the Bible and the other scriptural sources.
				These information are all in database tables,
				giving the author the luxury of using relational technology.
				The benefit includes storage and archive,
				that is, the work is usable in tabular format.
				There is a copy of the information running Microsoft SQL Server on a Linux operating system;
				which the author switches to, by changing the database connection string of one node in the web.config.
				When the user decides to stabilize and admit no further changes;
				then there is no need to do additional database update work.
				As with such work, the database schema remains consistent, since the beginning.
				The choice of word, meets today's expectations.
				The addition of the ActToGod table, demonstrates the maturity of the author,
				<span data-Dated="2024-04-25T17:49:00">
					since it advances from data to information.
				</span>
			</p>			
			
			<p>	
				The author, first wrote his history, in multiple stand-alone files .HTML, .XML.
				(<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Acts%207:22">Acts 7:22</a>).
				This documentation didn't allow for enough dating,
				to track creation and change, nor easy querying.
				Therefore, the decision to move to a relational database;
				that will augment this fact.
			</p>

			<p data-Dated="2021-07-05T10:10:00">
				Since the beginning, the author wrote a ContactMaintenance.aspx
				server-side page as a user-interface (UI) to record contact information.
				This page remains active, till today.
			</p>

			<p data-Dated="2021-07-05T10:10:00">
				The author uses Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
				to document general information.
				When the author is offsite, text editors provides a place to 
				scribble data manipulation language (DML)
				statements into SQL script files, for later execution.
				Please understand that both means mentioned above
				do not always support the checking of spellings nor grammar,

			<div data-Dated="2021-06-07T06:42:00">
				Adoptability: 
				<ol>
					<li>
						What is the minimum requirement?
						The author believes it is the
						Holy Spirit spreading the Word,
						and it is not him, making up the word.
						As long as you have the spirit of God,
						then you are receptive to this information sharing.
						The word is not always clearly heard,
						and the sighting is not always 20/20 visibile.
					</li>
					<li>
						What is the literacy level requirement?
						If you know the alphabets arrangements,
						then you can determine the AlphabetSequenceIndex by hand.
						To determine the AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference,
						you need to know, the count of chapters and verses.
						This manual work gives way to computation,
						which is not error prone.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Biblical account wrote dreams and visions textually,
						without resorting to the database.
						Search Engines Crawlers parse the standard HTML files and rarely query the database.
						The calendar: years, months, days,
						may benefit from the stipulation and generability of the Common Era.
					</li>
					<li>
						Where is the world leading and how do we follow it?
						The author fiddles with the idea of
						bringing technology to the Word of God.
						The author is unaware of the start and early beginnings
						of dictionaries, concordance and commentaries;
						but the author gains from this works as a reference.
						The widely acception of a work, accompanies preference and prevalence.
					</li>
					<li>
						The result of the Bible, is how we use it.
						The emphasises of Jesus Christ and apostle Paul is the word for today?
						As the author sees from the Bible,
						Moses assigned intervention to leaders, and Moses went to God as a higher authority.
						Who is the work for? Who can benefit from reading this work?

			<h3>To Whom Masculine?</h3>

			<p>
				How the Bible compares the gender?
			</p>
			
			<h4>Man, after his Fall</h4>
			<p>
				During Creation, God asked all living things, be fruitful and multiply;
				God asked Adam to name the living creatures,
				and God required Adam to take care of the Garden of Eden,
				but this taking care is to dress and keep the garden;
				there is a role for man, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and the tree of life.
				God did not specify the welfare of animals.
				Out of Adam, God made a helper for Adam, Eve.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the Fall of Man, Adam's labor will be thorough;
				and there is enmity between the serpent and Eve, and each other's seed;
				and Eve will have pain, during child-birth.
			</p>
			<p>
				God made coats of skins, and clothed them; it is our presumption, 
				that the clothing is from living things, generally perceived as sin sacrificial animal(s),
				but since this clothing is not specified, an alternative, is that it is a plant, or another creature entirely.
			</p>
			<p>
				God created an adult male, Adam; and his female counterpart, Eve
				(
					<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Deuteronomy%202:14,%20John%205:5">Deuteronomy 2:14, John 5:5</a>
				).
				There is no mention of Adam's activity, after the fall of man;
				as Eve bares and name their children; Adam's earlier effort, 
				which was to cater for the Garden of Eden and name the animals.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Man at Birth</h4>
			<p>
				We can only suggest, that the struggle between good and evil,
				continues upon the birth of Cain, Abel, and Seth.
				Eve named Cain, as her possession; and Seth, as the appointed seed.
			</p>
			<p>
				God instituted male circumcision, which should take place on the eighth day,
				as man's responsibility in keeping the Abrahamic covenant.
			</p>
			<p>
				At times, there is proclamation of a mantle, before livelihood;
				as in the case of Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Samson, John the Baptist, and Jesus Christ.
				In each example, there is a relationship between God and a parent;
				and God is directing, the offspring's onus.
				The want similar to Christ; is to see yourself, among fold.
			</p>

			<h4>Man's Task</h4>
			<p>
				Historical man's profession are keeper of sheep, a tiller of the ground,
				handle the harp and organ, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron.
				Unlike the first men, in the Bible, Seth's service was not identified,
				we only know that after the birth of Seth's son, Enos,
				men began to call, on the name of the LORD.
			</p>
			<p>
				The 10 Commandments details the relationship we aspire to have with God,
				and our fellow-men.
			</p>
			<p>
				God may consign men to overseer, as in the case of
				Melchizedek king of Salem, the priest of the most high God, and collector of tithes;
				Joseph, dreamer and interpreter, and he will save much life, in Egypt;
				as in incorporating the end.
				We share among us; as no foundation separates us.
			</p>

			<h3>Our choice is where we want to be? What we want to be?</h3>

The general format of the Bible is to place the book titles on the top, repeat the book titles and chapter numbers at the beginning of each chapter, and place the verse number beside its text.
In so doing, there are alphanumeric book titles, and numeric chapters and verses. For the work of the author there are tables with rows and columns.

					The SQL script contains four scripture references;
					therefore, there are four execution plans.
					Three of these execution plans,
					Query 1, 3 and 4,
					will solely 
					make use of the low cost clustered index primary key seek,
					PK_Scripture.
					These three have trivial optimization levels.
				</p>
				<p>
					Query 2 does an Index Seek on the IDX_Scripture_VerseIDSequence,
					since the where clause is on the VerseIDSequence column.
					The IDX_Scripture_VerseIDSequence indexes on the VerseIDSequence column;
					it is not a covering index, since the Select column-list
					includes the BookID, ChapterID, VerseID; therefore,
					the PK_Scripture is referenced as well in a Key Lookup.
					Both the Index Seek and the Key Lookup have Seek Predicates, and the Nested Loops will join the results.

				Between the age of twenty and twenty-four, the author developed Kowe, a word and graphic processor.
				
				Kowe is an editor, for typing; Kowe's innovation, is that the typist can 
				type 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritic</a>
				alphabets by using the function keys combined with the
				alternate, control, and shift keys.
				
				Line drawing is also possible with Kowe.
				
				Kowe will translate languages.

				Between 1997 - 1998, the author pursued his Doctorate at the University of Wollongong, 
				New South Wales (NSW), Australia; and he visited Villawood Detention Center, a place for 
				illegal migrants and asylum seekers, every Friday, as a Christian missionary.
				
				One of those migrants, a Ghanaian, had been at the detention center for up-to six years,
				and he corresponded with immigration officials, regularly.
				
				The author thought of building a website that will allow these migrants to share their
				experiences with the rest of the world.

				However, the Internet, was still in its infancy, and the author's knowledge was lacking.
				Also there were only dial-up access, at that time;
				and the inmates at Villawood, did not have computer access.
