				This dissertation introduces

				<span datetime="2020-09-15T00:00:00">
					The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference consists of four parts;
					there are two references each to particular chapters and verses.
					The first mention is the forward verse, which the author calculates by determining the AlphabetSequenceIndex verse in the Bible.
					The second mention is the forward chapter, and this the author calculates as before, but by substituting the verse with the chapter.
					Both the backward chapter and backward verse are the corresponding, anticlockwise places.

				<h3 datetime="2020-10-22T20:00:00">Data</h3>
			</q> (Vaibhav Verdhan)

			<h4>Structured and Unstructured</h4>
			
			<p>
				Structured data is alphanumeric put in row-column.
				Unstructured data is either text, image, audio, or video.
				This research is solely structured data.
			</p>

			<h4>Standard</h4>
			
			<p>
				The author imports complete, not NULL nor empty data, such as the Bible and the dictionaries.
			</p>

			<p>
				The author achieves data validity by constraining 
				and restricting inputs.
				Since this is not a commercial work, 
				Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are not vital.
			</p>

			<p>
				The author references and is not tampering with authoritative Bible work;
				this helps to make sure correctness - accuracy, consistency, integrity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Timeliness is effectual in the single user data entry table, HisWord.
			</p>

			<h3>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</h3>
			<h4>Class</h4>
			
			<p>
				The information which the author documents in this section of the paper;
				is the Data Declaration Language (DDL) and Data Dictionary,
				which is available at
				<a 
					href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/SQLServerDataDefinitionLanguageDDL"
				>
					GitHub.com SQLServerDataDefinitionLanguageDDL Repository
				</a>
				The Data Manipulation Language (DML) is too large to fit into the
				GitHub.com repository,
				and it is intellectual property.
				For the people that have access to the database,
				this private information is available by generating the database script.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Contact is a primary entity, and it identifies the people and organizations that the
				author has a relationship with.
				These affiliations are family, friends, or business links.
				Also recordable are the street, e-mail, web addresses, and telephone numbers.
				The author stores the various information exchanges with these people.
				A known date of birth, is for notification of the subject's birthday and relative age.
				To keep up with the privacy and sensitivity of this personal information,
				the author is not sharing this highly confidential data.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The relationship between a contact and its related information is one to many;
				that is a contact may have multiple addresses.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A URI is a link to a web resource that will add to the audience's knowledge.
				The author notes the address and the date, when the author became aware
				of this information.
				The content at an address is either textual, audio, video, or image?
				
				The author only records the
				<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> 
				address' at the place of reference 
				since it is easy to associate the title with the Wikipedia address. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These classes are important asset for the anniversary triggers;
				in the Remember entries.
			</p>
				
			<h3>Database and Application Server Source Files</h3>
			<p>
				The author chose a multi-tier architecture for building the application.

				The database layer is made-up of tables, views, stored procedures, functions.
				The database tables are easily storable and movable to other storage media.
						
				The SQL Server's data definition language (DDL), now supports DateTime2, 
				and its date range extend between January 1, 1 CE through December 31, 9999 CE.
				Some dates in 
				<a href="http://www.Wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> mention these dates.
						
				The HisWord_view contains computed columns,
				which depend on entries in the HisWord table.

				The author extracts database information by building query statements.
				<br/>

				The application layer is the bridge between the user interface layer and the database layer.

				The application layer compiles into a single 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library">Dynamic-link library</a>
				(DLL), called InformationInTransit.dll.

				The application layer consists of four namespaces, namely,
				
				InformationInTransit.DataAccess,
				InformationInTransit.ProcessCode,
				InformationInTransit.ProcessLogic,
				InformationInTransit.UserInterface.
				
				What the author builds on the server; is accessible to all the clients.
				
				What is the lifetime of this code, and what neutrality does it condone?
									
				The author started out with 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase">dBASE II</a>.
				
				The lines of code for the application layer are in the C# and embedded SQL.
			</p>
				
			<h3>Client Browser Source Files</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> (.html)</li>
					<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (.js)</li>
					<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (.css)</li>
				</ul>
				
				The .HTML files will work in all browsers; that support AJAX.

				Most of the interactive web pages are reliant on JavaScript to work, 
				mainly because they use Ajax to interact with the server.
				
				Each .HTML file, performs specific task, 
				and may have a corresponding back-end associate, web service.

				The Unobtrusive JavaScript file
				<a href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/IIS/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.js">9432.js</a>
				contain re-usable code that are not .HTML files specific.
				
				The .HTML files originally contained the .CSS specifications; 
				however, the author now places styling information, in a single external file,
				<a href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/IIS/WordEngineering/WordUnion/9432.css">9432.css</a>.
				This will reduce the sizes of the .HTML files, and it helps to achieve a common user interface.

				<h4 id="CascadingStyleSheetsCSS" datetime="2021-05-06T21:00:00">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Base Rules:
						A base rule is an element and not a class nor ID selector.
						The author does not use CSS Resets.
						The author issues element selectors for the html, body, table and row.
					</li>
					<li>
						Layout Rules:
						There are no layout rules, such as header nor footer.
					</li>
					<li>
						Module Rules:
						The table of content (TOC) is for page navigation
						that the author offers using class names.
					</li>
					<li>
						State Rules:
						A state rule is for toggling, such as using Javascript to set the visibility.

			<h3>Web Services</h3>
			<p>
				<q cite="#bibliographyFrederikBulthoff2019">
					We have standardized on the first .NET web services architecture, .ASMX.
				</q>
				(FrederikBulthoff, 2019)
				In most cases, there is a one-to-one mapping between the .HTML, .ASMX, .CS files,
				and the database relational table, Bible..Scripture.
				For simplicity and clearage of use, the .HTML and .ASMX files, support one operation.
				This is not the case, with the GetAPage.html file, which is the workhorse, for word spoken.
				With a single field entry, GetAPage.html, sends AJAX requests to multiple .ASMX files
				and operations; GetAPage.html is a cumulative of previously isolated .HTML files.
				All the web services files support a single request format, SOAP; and return JSON.
				jQuery accepts the POST, HTTP verb.
				The author stringified the data he passes to the web service, in the body of the message.
				Errors are unforeseen, in the rare case, the author logs errors on the back-end, 
				and display quantitative message.
				Security is lacking; this is permissible, since the author only queries information,
				and the Bible database can be readonly.
			</p>

			<p>	
				The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) is available,
				for example, by specifying the URI,
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL">AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL</a>
				To generate a proxy code, issue the following command;
				<code>
					wsdl.exe /language:CS /namespace:InformationInTransit.ProcessLogic /out:"AlphabetSequenceWebServiceProxy.cs" http://localhost/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.asmx?WSDL
				</code>	
				The Web Services Discovery Utility (disco) command:
				<code>
					disco.exe "http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequenceWebService.disco"
				</code>
				will generate the companion files;
				AlphabetSequenceWebService.disco,
				AlphabetSequenceWebService.wsdl,
				and results.discomap	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A lecture of our beginning.	
				(Hafida Na ̈ım, 2016)
				The business rule is storable and processable in C#, (.cs), source files.
				The dynamic link library, (.dll), is callable from everywhere.
				GetAPage.html computes AlphabetSequence from a simple logic,
				which is easily representable anywhere.
				The scripture reference is retrievable from the Bible, using non-complex SQL query.
				The Bible word and HisWord reference, requires substantiated query.
				The Bible dictionary returns dataset from the local database.
				The author can not make a business decision, to go to a web service, to retrieve what is locally resideable.
			</p>
		
			<h3>Database Size</h3>
			<p>
				The usp_DatabaseLogSize stored procedure is for determining the size of the databases data files;
				and it is available at
				<a href="http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/T-SQL-to-find-DataLogSize-3564cfc0">T-SQL to find Data,Log,Size and Other Useful information -SQL 2000/2005/2008/R2</a>.

			</p>
			
			<h4>Database Design</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>The relational model is for storing information in tables.</li>
				<li>The author normalizes data using Object-relational mapping.</li>
				<li>All the databases are OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), not OLAP (Online analytical processing).</li>
				<li>Avoid deadlock occurrences by not permitting user database updates.</li>
				<li>All the transactions follow similar routes and sequences, and the author practices granularity with the locks.</li>
				<li>Database updates are through stored procedures, which recognize and avoid the potential of integrity violation.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Database Security</h4>	
			<ol>
				<li>The secretive web.config file contains the database access information.</li>
				<li>The web.config file does not explicitly mention the user login name nor password.</li>
				<li>Give access rights to roles, not to specific login identities nor user names.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>Database Data Types</h4>	
			<ol>

			<h3 id="BibleDatabase">The Bible Database</h3>
				
			<h4 id="ScriptureTable">The Scripture Table</h4>
			<p>
				The Bible SQL Server database, principally consists, of one table, the Scripture table.
				
				The Scripture table has a 
				<a href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/jeffs/archive/2007/08/23/composite_primary_keys.aspx">composite primary key</a>,
				which consists of three columns; the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID columns.
				
				There are varchar(MAX) columns which has the text for each Bible version.
			</p>	
			<p>	
				The author proposes creating a non-unique index,
				IDX_Scripture_ChapterIDSequence,
				on the ChapterIDSequence column.
				The author is undecided, if this index will be clustered or non-clustered.
			</p>
			
			<h5 id="ScriptureTableBookIDColumn">The Scripture Table's BookID Column</h5>
		
			<p>
				Because there are sixty-six books in the Bible, the BookID ranges between 1 and 66;
				starting from Genesis and ending at Revelation.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT CK_Scripture_BookID_Range CHECK (BookID BETWEEN 1 AND 66)</code>
				will set the range restriction.

				The BookID participates in the natural primary key; 
				and it is part of the composite index with the ChapterID and VerseID columns.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>
				ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD  CONSTRAINT [PK_Scripture] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
				(
					[bookId] ASC,
					[chapterId] ASC,
					[verseId] ASC
				)
				</code>
				is for setting the primary key.
			</p>

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableChapterIDColumn">The Scripture Table's ChapterID Column</h5>
			<p>
				The ChapterID ranges between 1 and 150; 
				the SQL statement
				<code>SELECT MAX(ChapterID) FROM Bible..Scripture</code> 
				is for determining the upper limit.
				
				The SQL statement 
				<code>ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [CK_Scripture_ChapterID_Range] CHECK  (([ChapterID]&gt;=(1) AND [ChapterID]&lt;=(150)))</code>
				will set the range restriction.
			</p>

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableVerseIDColumn">The Scripture Table's VerseID Column</h5>
		
			<p>
				The VerseID ranges between 1 and 176; 
				the SQL statement
				<code>SELECT MAX(VerseID) FROM Bible..Scripture</code> 
				is for determining the upper limit.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [CK_Scripture_VerseID_Range] CHECK  (([VerseID]&gt;=(1) AND [VerseID]&lt;=(176)))</code>
				will set the range restriction.
			</p>	

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableKingJamesVersionColumn">The Scripture Table's KingJamesVersion Column</h5>

			<p>
				The author would have considered placing an index
				on the KingJamesVersion column, but the author found out during his research, 
				that the KingJamesVersion is not unique, and indexes
				are not applicable to like query expressions with leading wildcards.
			</p>	

			<h5 id="Scripture_ViewTestamentColumn">The Scripture View's Testament Column</h5>

			<p>
				The SQL statement 
				<code>(case when [BookId]&lt;=(39) then 'Old' else 'New' end)</code>
				will set this computed column.
				The Testament column serves as a filter, such as, in the
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html">BibleWord</a>.
			</p>	

			<h5 id="Scripture_ViewBookTitleColumn">The Scripture View's BookTitle Column</h5>

			<p>
				The SQL statement 
				<code>[dbo].[udf_BookTitle]([BookID])</code>
				is for determining this computed column.
				
				As expected, there is a correlation between the BookID column, and 
				and its corresponding BookTitle column,
				it progresses from Genesis to Revelation.
				
				Because SQL does not support arrays, the author, chose to write a 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_CLR">SQL CLR</a> 
				C# function for determining the BookTitle, when passed the BookID.
				
				Although, C# supports
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design by contract</a>,
				assertions, but the author only checks BookID range validity, and return NULL, if the
				argument does not fall within this range. We could throw exceptions,
				but the author does not know the side effect nor ramification.
				
				Instead of writing and determining the BookTitle using C#,
				an alternative is to use a database table.
				A table with two columns, BookID and BookTitle, 
				will store and make
				<span datetime="2021-03-17T19:11:00">extractable</span>
				the sixty-six books.
			</p>	
			
			<h5 id="ScriptureTableScriptureReferenceColumn">The Scripture Table's ScriptureReference Column</h5>

			<p>
				The SQL statement 
				<code>[dbo].[udf_ScriptureReference]([BookID], [ChapterID], [VerseID])</code>
				will calculate the conjecture of the BookTitle, ChapterID, and VerseID.
				
				Since this is a computed column; therefore, you can not set its 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_integrity">Entity Integrity</a>;
				if it were not; the SQL statement 
				<code>ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT uc_Scripture_ScriptureReference UNIQUE (ScriptureReference)</code> 
				will set its entity integrity.
				The distinction between raw data versus computed columns is performance, space.
				<span datetime="2020-10-06T15:05:00">
				For example the beginning book of the New Testament, the 40th book, spelling is Matthew or Mathew, double tt versus single t.
				An improvement on the current implementation is to use soundex to decipher the title of the book.
				</span>
			</p>	

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableChapterIDSequenceColumn">The Scripture Table's ChapterIDSequence Column</h5>

			<p>
				When loading data, the author decides the ChapterIDSequence column;
				and increment it, every time, the BookID and ChapterID,
				changes during load.

				The ChapterIDSequence ranges between 1 and 1189; starting from Genesis 1 and ending at Revelation 22.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					SELECT BookID, ChapterID FROM Bible..Scripture GROUP BY BookID, ChapterID ORDER BY BookID, ChapterID
				</code>
				will decide the greatest value for ChapterIDSequence.
				
				An alternative SQL statement 
				<code>
					select count(
					distinct
						cast(BookID as varchar(6))
						+ ' '
						+ cast(ChapterID as varchar(6))
					)
					FROM	Bible..Scripture
				</code>

				Another SQL statement 
				<code>
					; with cte
					(
						  BookID
						, chapterID
					)
					as
					(
						select distinct BookID, chapterID
						FROM	Bible..Scripture
					)
					select cnt = count(*)
					from   cte
				</code>
				
				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT  CK_Scripture_ChapterIDSequence_Range CHECK (ChapterIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 1189)
				</code>
				will do the range correctness.
			
				Although it is good to know the ChapterIDSequence, 
				but it is primarily used to decide
				the boundaries for scripture reference queries.
			</p>	

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableVerseIDSequenceColumn">The Scripture Table's VerseIDSequence Column</h5>

			<p>
				When loading data, the author calculates the VerseIDSequence column,
				and increments it, every time, 
				the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID
				changes during the data load.
				
				There are some Bible books that have only one chapter,
				such as,
				Obadiah, Philemon, 2 John, 3 John, Jude;
				therefore, the author is careful when the choice is made to 
				increment and update the VerseIDSequence column.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					SELECT BookTitle FROM Bible..Scripture GROUP BY BookID, BookTitle HAVING MAX(ChapterID) = 1 ORDER BY BookID
				</code>
				is for listing these one chapter, Bible books.

				The VerseIDSequence ranges between 1 and 31102; starting from Genesis 1:1,
				and ending at Revelation 22:21.

				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Bible..Scripture
				</code>
				will decide the greatest value for VerseIDSequence,
				the total number of rows, records, in the Bible..Scripture table.
				
				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture ADD CONSTRAINT  CK_Scripture_VerseIDSequence_Range CHECK (VerseIDSequence BETWEEN 1 AND 31102)
				</code>
				will do the data integrity.
			
				As said earlier, although it is good to know the VerseIDSequence, 
				but it is primarily used to decide
				the boundaries for scripture reference queries.

				The identity functionality which auto-increments,
				before inserting each row is useful,
				for ensuring this candidate primary key,
				abides by the entity integrity constraint; however,
				
				The SQL statement 
				<code>
					ALTER TABLE Bible..Scripture
					ADD CONSTRAINT AK_Scripture_VerseIDSequence UNIQUE (VerseIDSequence)   
				</code>
				is supplementary.
			</p>	

			<h5 id="ScriptureTableBibleReferenceColumn">The Scripture_View BibleReference Column</h5>

			<p>
				The SQL statement 
				<code>((right('00'+CONVERT([varchar](2),[bookId],(0)),(2))+right('000'+CONVERT([varchar](3),[chapterId],(0)),(3)))+right('000'+CONVERT([varchar](3),[verseId],(0)),(3)))</code>
				will combine the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID.
			
				This is a convention for referring to Bible rows, by a unique identifier,
				which consists of the BookID, ChapterID, and VerseID.
				The leading zeros are placeholders for blocks of IDs, such as,
				BookID which will have two digits,
				ChapterID which will have three digits,
				and VerseID which will also have three digits.
				It is easier, faster, and more compact to restrict and order by numbers than text.
							
				Listed below, is the result set, for this SQL statement.
				<code>
					SELECT ScriptureReference, BibleReference
					FROM Bible..Scripture_View
					WHERE BookID = 43 AND ChapterID = 1 AND VerseID = 1
				</code>

				Most of the applications, extract information, and query the Scripture table.
				If the user chooses to, he may choose to load another Bible version,

			<h4 id="ExactTable">The Exact Table</h4>
				
			<p>
				The 
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/Exact.html?bibleWord=KAA">Exact</a>
				table's, primary task, is to tell, on the words 
				that are in the Bible. Its information set include each word's first and last 
				scripture reference occurrence(s), and count of occurrence(s).
				If the word, occurs only once, then the last occurrence is null.
				The incentive for writing the exact module comes from 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Hunt_%28Christian_apologist%29">Dave Hunt</a>,
				who will talk of each word's specifics,
				and 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Missler">Chuck Missler</a>
				who noted that the first occurrence of the word,
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/BibleWord.html?bibleWord=Love&amp;wholeWords=false">love</a>
				is in
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%2022:2">Genesis 22:2</a>.
				
				The exact table, is a holding area, for staging information;
				it could be argued that there is no need, to have this table,
				because it sources its information from the Scripture table, and it is available using
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">Language Integrated Query</a>.
				The reasoning of the author is that the Scripture table is static data, and it does not need
				processing, each time, there is a request.
				Speed and lower work load are the advantages of our procedure;
				its disadvantage is that the exact table needs re-population,
				when there is a shift to another Bible version, which we do not project, at this time.
				If there is a need, to support another Bible version, then the 
				exact table loading procedure needs expansion to aid,
				this flexibility.
				
				The 
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/Exact.html?bibleWord=KAA">Exact</a>

			</p>

			<h5 id="ExactTableExactIDColumn">The Exact Table's ExactID Column</h5>
			
			<p>
				The ExactID is an 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_column">identity column</a>,
				meaning the database, SQL Server, auto-increments its value, before insertion.
				There are 12891 unique words, in the Bible..Exact table.
								
				The SQL statement 
				<code>SELECT MAX(ExactID) FROM Bible..Exact</code>
				is for determining the highest value.
				
				The SQL statement 
				<code>SELECT COUNT(BibleWord) FROM Bible..Exact</code>
				is for determining the word count.
				
				The SQL statement 
				<code>ALTER TABLE Bible..Exact ADD CONSTRAINT  CK_Exact_ExactID_Range CHECK (ExactID BETWEEN 1 AND 12891)</code>
				is for the range restriction.

				For storage reason, the author has chosen, not to have a unique index,
				on this candidate primary key; in-spite, of it being a query item.
								
				Future implementation, may issue the SQL statement 
				<code>CREATE UNIQUE INDEX AK_Exact_ExactID ON Bible..Exact(ExactID)</code>
				
				<code datetime="2020-12-14T16:51:00">SELECT SUM(FrequencyOfOccurrence) FROM Bible..Exact</code>

				The author may set-up the relationship by issuing the SQL statement
				<code>ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Exact]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [FK_Exact_Scripture] FOREIGN KEY(FirstOccurrenceScriptureReference) REFERENCES dbo.Scripture (ScriptureReference)</code>.
				Please note, that as discussed earlier,
				the author does not have, a unique constraint, on the Bible..Scripture.ScriptureReference column,
				since this is a computed column;
				the author can not keep up the relationship, at this time.
			</p>

			<h5 id="ExactTableLastOccurrenceScriptureReferenceColumn">The Exact Table's LastOccurrenceScriptureReference Column</h5>
			
			<p>
				This is the reference to the scripture where the word last occurs in the Bible;

			<h5 id="ExactTableDifferenceColumn">The Exact Table's Difference Column</h5>

			<h4 id="HisWord">The HisWord Table</h4>

			</p>

			<p>
				There have been cases, when the author cannot spell, and fully comprehend, what he heard.
				In such cases, and not dispose of the records, the author will partly enter what

				This impedance mismatch, between what the speaker said, and what the listener heard,

				The author has sought a Yoruba dictionary and translator,
				a recent success is with the <a href="http://translate.google.com">http://translate.google.com</a> web page.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Innovative made, as a concession towards the Hispanic community, 
				especially after the interview with
				<a href="http://www.cetweb.org">Center for Employment Training</a>
				and 
				<a href="http://www.yesvideo.com">YesVideo.com</a>,
				was to extend the HisWord table with include columns.
				
				These columns will find, when group of words occur,
				these words are numbers, colors, animals, plants, 
				or other word groupings.
				
				The advantage of this approach, is that it helps non-language speakers
				to better decipher word meanings, and it offers an opportunity to use statistics
				to see word and grouping trends.
			</p>
			
			<p>	
				The HisWord table's most important column, 
				as the name suggests, is the word column,
				which is either English or Yoruba; or a mixture of both languages.
				When a word is in the Yoruba language, the author, will yield to the Holy Spirit,
				in translating the word from Yoruba to English.
				
				From previous experience, this translation is not always the most right or relevant, and
				different words may contain the diacritic alphabets; therefore, introduce various meanings
				(<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=1%20Corinthians%2012:30,%201%20Corinthians%2014">1 Corinthians 12:30, 1 Corinthians 14</a>).
				
				To account for the discrepancy in translation, the author sought help from the LORD;
				and at about, 
				2015-11-02T22:55:00 In a dream, the LORD said, And, the merge, is the money, convert.
				2015-11-03T02:17:00 In a dream, the LORD said, The specifics, a language.
			</p>

			<p>	
				The word column is a potential natural primary key, since duplicates are rare.
				When redundancies do occur, we may append the sequence to the word,
				to generate a unique word.
				
				We do this manually, but an 
				<a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/plsql/plsql_triggers.htm">insert trigger</a>,
				will offer automation, and will cut the risk of primary key violation,
				which leads to gaps in the identity column.
			</p>

			<p>
				The HisWord's table, commentary column, is the implicit information, received from the LORD.
				This communication is most likely non-verbal, and it is information comprehended by the author
				during dream and vision, like creatures standing or moving towards particular locations,
				or engaging in other visible activities.
			</p>

			<p>
				As such, from the creation account, on the first day, there is a commandment, and there
				may be an action/response.
				
				The commandment is in the word column God created light
				(
					<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%201:3,%205">
						Genesis 1:3, 5
					</a>
				).

				The action is in the commentary column; God separated the light from the darkness
				(<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Genesis%201:1-2,%204">Genesis 1:1-2, 4</a>).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The HisWordID column is an 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_column">identity column</a> 
				maintained by SQL Server, which automatically generates a sequential next identity.
				The goodness of this technique is that it is a candidate primary key,
				data loss is trackable, and it provides a sort key.
				
				The HisWordID column may serve as the 
				<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_primarykey.asp">primary</a>
				and/or
				<a href="http://www.1keydata.com/sql/sql-foreign-key.html">foreign key</a>, 
				the backbone of the 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity">Referential Integrity Constraint</a>.
				
				It is debatable, the need for this identity column when there is a dated column
				which does similar work and
				offers almost identical benefit; the author will discuss the dated column, next.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Dated column, as the name implies, is of the DateTime type.
				If an insert statement does not explicitly specify a value for the dated column, 
				then it defaults to the current date and time of the
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone">(UTC-08:00) Pacific Time (US &amp; Canada) time zone</a>.
				
				There is a preference for the

			<h4 id="Hisword_view">HisWord_view</h4>
			<p>
				The HisWord_view composes of the computed columns deducted from analyzing the Word 
				received by the author.
				
				The two most significant computations are the AlphabetSequenceIndex, and the
				reliant AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference, respectively.
				
				The author derives the AlphabetSequenceIndex from the word by adding the place
				of the letters in the alphabet set. 
				
				In the ASCII table, the lower case letters are between 97 and 122, and the
				upper case letters are between 65 and 90.

				The lower and upper case letters have the same places.
				For example, the places of letter A and a is 1; 
				and the places of letter Z and z is 26.
				
				The AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference is the books, chapters, verses separation in the scripture.
				
				The author considers the chapter and verse sequences, in forward and backward orders.
				
				Use the
				<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/AlphabetSequence.html">AlphabetSequence.html</a>
				to calculate the computed values identified above.
				
				The AlphabetSequence is like

				If the research of the author is a team effort;

				The author will place non-Microsoft DLLs in the virtual directory bin sub-directory,
				and the author will refer to Microsoft DLLs in the web.config file.
			</p>

			<p>
				The web.config is generally consistent across deployment,
				the only variable is the database server name,
				and when the application and database server exists
				on the same machine,
				the connectionStrings may use Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=master;Integrated Security=SSPI. 
				This means that the author will explictly specify the database, object owner, and system object name.
				The Application pool will take care of the security.
				There are no environment variables, in use, at this time.
				The HTML files, when calling web services, will specify the full virtual directory path,
				but when appending css and JavaScript files, relative directories will suffice,
				full path directory and filename is unnecessary and an overkill.

			<p>
				The author standardized on Microsoft SQL Server as the relational database of choice.
				There are several alternatives in the market.
				All database interaction goes through one access point, 
				<a href="http://github.com/KenAdeniji/WordEngineering/blob/master/InformationInTransit/DataAccess/DataCommand.cs">DataCommand.cs</a>,

				will issue a unique quote-of-the-day, every day;
				and a random quote, every time.
				The author program uses the release version of jQuery, which is the most up-to-date.
				The web services, such as, Sefaria.org, should not need code-revisit.
				The code in the third-party libraries, such as, Newtonsoft.Json.dll, is consistent,
				and should rarely need re-deployment.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The application is mostly stateless except for the database read.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Internet Information Server (IIS) HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
				by default runs on port 80, like other web servers, but this is modifiable.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Using the current architecture, the author takes care of concurrency and deadlocks;
				because database writes rarely occur and are short, reads are tolerant.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The threads are simple and conclusive; therefore,
				there are small start-up and short-down periods.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is unity between the development and production
				team, environment, and time frame.
				The same knowledge worker can write, deploy, and run code.

				It is firstly, a database work.
				That is the author records God's word.
				What the author hears, he relates to the Bible and the other scriptural sources.
				These information are all in database tables,
				giving the author the luxury of using relational technology.
				The benefit includes storage and archive,
				that is, the work is usable in tabular format.
				There is a copy of the information running Microsoft SQL Server on a Linux operating system;
				which the author switches to, by changing the database connection string of one node in the web.config.
				When the user decides to stabilize and admit no further changes;
				then there is no need to do additional database update work.
				As with such work, the database schema remains consistent, since the beginning.
				The choice of word, meets today's expectations.
				The addition of the ActToGod table, demonstrates the maturity of the author.
			</p>			
			
			<p>	
				The author, first wrote his history, in multiple stand-alone files (HTML, XML)
				(<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/ScriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Acts%207:22">Acts 7:22</a>).
				This documentation didn't allow for enough dating,
				to track creation and change, nor easy querying.

				that will augment this fact.

				Adoptability:

					<li>
						What is the minimum requirement?
						The author believes it is the
						Holy Spirit spreading the Word,
						and it is not him, making up the word.
						As long as you have the spirit of God,
						then you are receptive to this information sharing.
						The word is not always clearly heard,
						and the sighting is not always 20/20 visibile.
					</li>
					<li>
						What is the literacy level requirement?
						If you know the alphabets arrangements,
						then you can determine the AlphabetSequenceIndex by hand.
						To determine the AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference,
						you need to know, the count of chapters and verses.
						This manual work gives way to computation,
						which is not error prone.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Biblical account wrote dreams and visions textually,
						without resorting to the database.
						Search Engines Crawlers parse the standard HTML files and rarely query the database.
						The calendar: years, months, days,
						may benefit from the stipulation and generability of the Common Era.
					</li>
					<li>
						Where is the world leading and how do we follow it?
						The author fiddles with the idea of
						bringing technology to the Word of God.
						The author is unaware of the start and early beginnings
						of dictionaries, concordance and commentaries;
						but the author gains from this works as a reference.
						The widely acception of a work, accompanies preference and prevalence.
					</li>
					<li>
						The result of the Bible, is how we use it.
						The emphasises of Jesus Christ and apostle Paul is the word for today?
						As the author sees from the Bible,
						Moses assigned intervention to leaders, and Moses went to God as a higher authority.
						Who is the work for? Who can benefit from reading this work?
						Our appraisal of others; is how we are made.

			<h3>I Am taking you, on a journey</h3>
			
			<p>
				The first word, God spoke to the author, is <q>I Am taking you, on a journey.</q>.
				This was before my deportation to Nigeria, as a twenty year old, in 1988.
				
				Twenty Biblical years after I was born is 1987-07-02.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				On the train, from my home at Parramatta, towards my work at Powersoft, North Sydney.
				Showing off with a laptop computer from work.
				There is a particular sin in your life. I cannot help it. I can help you, with all things.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				On the night of 1997-12-31, I have brought something against you.
			</p>

			<p>
				On 1998-05-08, God said, <q>Out of Egypt, have I called My son.</q>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Progress</h3>
			<p>
				After the author conceived the notion for AlphabetSequence,
				he stored the word spoken into XML files, along with manually
				determining the relevant Bible word.
				This, the author did, because the author thought and felt that the readers
				will prefer to read the recent information,
				and they do not have to regurgitate the entire database.
				The author was living at Newark, and working from Fremont.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The author recorded, the FromUntil Time Span, explicitly into the
				Remember's table commentary column.
				Now, there are three computed columns, managing this period(s);
				these are the days difference, the Biblical time period, and Common Era computation.
				The author is saving memory storage space this way.
				And, also offering the opportunity to other people, the
				possibility to calculate their preferred period.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Using the knowledge learnt from horizontal replication and partition,
				the audience are no longer forced to accept the author's calendar.
				The audience can choose their acceptable fact, and
				ignore nor standard derivation.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The history, this way, is to say;
				at the begining, the author will record every entry after six p.m.
				as the next day saying, just like the Jewish day starts at 6 p.m.
				With the reasoning advent, the Tanakh, the New Testament, and the Koran,
				the truth partiality, is our governance.
			</p>
			
			<h3>The basic of facilitating the truth</h3>
			
			<p>
				Most words have precedence, and do not exist in an emptiness.
				Words follow a trend.
				Are their supportive collaboration, to the utterance the author hears;
				these are linkable for historical evidence.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				How do we give our actualities?
				I have found written text, the easiest and most applicable way
				of sharing thoughts.
				Words spoken, when passed from generation to generation,
				may gain legend status, and therefore, lose appropriateness.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Examine the course of history?
				You will find, that most truth, are actually realizing the dream.
				In my case, when I try to recall, the past, I search by keywords,
				numbers and dates.
				So, entries in the word, are most to realization.
				The first words spoken have higher importance and closer affinity;
				so also, prophetic application, have standard occurrence.
			</p>

			<p datetime="2020-12-26T12:04:00">
				Our work, so much depends on data entry.
				The Remember table relies on relationship, deductive reasoning.
			</p>

			<h3 datetime="2018-08-24T17:37:56">Can we look at the Messianic prophecies? Merit their lives</h3>
			
			<p>
				For example, our Paschal Lamb, sacrificed His life, on the cross.
				And, the scripture says, cursed is he who dies on a cross.
				There are four directions on a cross,
				AlphabetSequenceIndexScriptureReference offers four references,
				which consists of two chapters, and two verses.
				West and East, husband and wife; North to South, children.
			</p>

				).
				It is up-to us to decipher, to spell out what we heard; and to describe the scenery.
				The Yoruba letters are like English letters, perhaps because of colonization;
				and we try our best to contain these letters, within the ASCII table.

			<p>
				In the first words, in the Bible, God referred to the beginning, of His work,
				giving time, an annotation.
				God also mentioned two places, heaven and earth, creation generally centers
				on the activities on the earth; and God we understand, resides in the heaven,
				the last point for good on earth.
				To seek a development; it had a beginning.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the second sentence, second verse, God mentions, that the earth was
				without form and void; meaning the earth was without content.
				Nothing was a member of the earth.
				Also, God's spirit, a member of God, moved across the water.
			</p>

			<p>
				When time is maximal used; time is ideal allowed.
				When our association to follow; is association to the end.

			<h3>To Whom Masculine?</h3>

			<p>
				How the Bible compares the gender?
			</p>
			
			<h4>Man, after his Fall</h4>
			<p>
				During Creation, God asked all living things, be fruitful and multiply;
				God asked Adam to name the living creatures,
				and God required Adam to take care of the Garden of Eden,
				but this taking care is to dress and keep the garden;
				there is a role for man, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and the tree of life.
				God did not specify the welfare of animals.
				Out of Adam, God made a helper for man, Eve.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the Fall of Man, Adam's labor will be thorough;
				and there is enmity between the serpent and Eve, and each other's seed;
				and Eve will have pain, during child-birth.
			</p>
			<p>
				God made coats of skins, and clothed them; it is our presumption, 
				that the clothing is from living things, generally perceived as sin sacrificial animal(s),
				but since this clothing is not specified, an alternative, is that it is a plant, or another creature entirely.
			</p>
			<p>
				God created an adult male, Adam; and his female counterpart, Eve
				(
					<a href="http://e-comfort.ephraimtech.com/WordEngineering/WordUnion/scriptureReference.html?scriptureReference=Deuteronomy%202:14,%20John%205:5">Deuteronomy 2:14, John 5:5</a>
				).
				There is no mention of Adam's activity, after the fall of man;
				as Eve bares and name their children; Adam's earlier effort, 
				which was to cater for the Garden of Eden and name the animals.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Man at Birth</h4>
			<p>
				We can only suggest, that the struggle between good and evil,
				continues upon the birth of Cain, Abel, and Seth.
				Eve named Cain, as her possession; and Seth, as the appointed seed.
			</p>
			<p>
				God instituted male circumcision, which should take place on the eighth day,
				as man's responsibility in keeping the Abrahamic covenant.
			</p>
			<p>
				At times, there is proclamation of a mantle, before livelihood;
				as in the case of Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Samson, John the Baptist, and Jesus Christ.
				In each example, there is a relationship between God and a parent;
				and God is directing, the offspring's onus.
				The want similar to Christ; is to see yourself, among fold.
			</p>

			<h4>Man's Task</h4>
			<p>
				Historical man's profession are keeper of sheep, a tiller of the ground,
				handle the harp and organ, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron.
				Unlike the first men, in the Bible, Seth's service was not identified,
				we only know that after the birth of Seth's son, Enos,
				men began to call, on the name of the LORD.
			</p>
			<p>
				The 10 Commandments details the relationship we aspire to have with God,
				and our fellow-men.
			</p>
			<p>
				God may consign men to overseer, as in the case of
				Melchizedek king of Salem, the priest of the most high God, and collector of tithes;
				Joseph, dreamer and interpreter, and he will save much life, in Egypt;
				as in incorporating the end.
				We share among us; as no foundation separates us.
			</p>

				SQL returns records in rows; there is a result set.
				Would we, be able, to amalgate the result set?
				For example, how can we, find themes in the Bible?
				When you enter a topic, can we return a trend?

				The author's work is an individual effort,
				and it targets a singular person.
				The work are separated into web pages,
				but the user may click on a hyperlink,
				to get more information,
				and sometime do additional work.
				The author's work, builds on the efforts of other people,
				like the Bible, dictionary and commentary.
				The HisWord table and associated queries,
				only currently refers to the author's contribution.
				How could we, specialize our work?
				Who uses, and for what?
				The setting, is it normal?
				What are the influence of God, as a person?
				What are His contribution, solely to man?
				What part of Him, as He analyzed, as a person?
				What role, as man, placed on Me?
				What stimulate you, as a human being; is where My opinion placed?
				The author read the Bible and listened to His word,
				prior to the introduction of AlphabetSequence.
				Where do we follow, His partnership?
				He has said the word; I have collaborated with Him.

			<h4>Outstanding Work</h4>

			<p datetime="2021-06-21T22:09:00">
				The source code and schema are available at Github.com.
				This means that the public can review and make updates
				to the original work of the author.
				This aged work is not up-to-date with the industry trend, 
				such as cloud computing,
				mobile applications, decentralized ledger, nosql.
				Part of the justification for this immaturity;
				is the need to maintain a low entry point
				and capture a wide audience
				for its adoption.

				When you write a thesis, it is a paradigm work, shift in thinking,

				The practice of the author will be to list existing words, and include their meanings.
				For technical jargons, the author will rely on the Internet, as a definition resource.
				If the author is introducing a new word, the author will explain its meaning, but this is rare.

					The SQL script contains four scripture references;
					therefore, there are four execution plans.
					Three of these execution plans,
					Query 1, 3 and 4,
					will solely 
					make use of the low cost clustered index primary key seek,
					PK_Scripture.
					These three have trivial optimization levels.
				</p>
				<p>
					Query 2 does an Index Seek on the IDX_Scripture_VerseIDSequence,
					since the where clause is on the VerseIDSequence column.
					The IDX_Scripture_VerseIDSequence indexes on the VerseIDSequence column;
					it is not a covering index, since the Select column-list
					includes the BookID, ChapterID, VerseID; therefore,
					the PK_Scripture is referenced as well in a Key Lookup.
					Both the Index Seek and the Key Lookup have Seek Predicates, and the Nested Loops will join the results.

				19225 days (53 biblical years, 4 biblical months, 25 days) (52 years, 7 months, 2 weeks, 5 days).

			<p>
				The Yoruba tribe speak the Yoruba language and the Yorubas are in the South West of Nigeria.
				The Yorubas practice the Christians and Moslems religions.
				The East of Nigeria include the Ibos who speak the Igbo language and are mainly Catholics.
				The Hausas and Fulanis are in the North of Nigeria. 
				At the Highway 880 South Fremont Exit, the road separates into two, the Alvarado Boulevard, West direction, and Fremont Boulevard, East direction.

				The author's primary languages are English, a 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages">Germanic</a> language;
				and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language">Yoruba</a>, a language
				spoken by western Nigerians.
				
				Between the age of twenty and twenty-four, the author developed Kowe, a word and graphic processor.
				
				Kowe is an editor, for typing; Kowe's innovation, is that the typist can 
				type 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritic</a>
				alphabets by using the function keys combined with the
				alternate, control, and shift keys.
				
				Line drawing is also possible with Kowe.
				
				Kowe will translate languages.

				Between 1997 - 1998, the author pursued his Doctorate at the University of Wollongong, 
				New South Wales (NSW), Australia; and he visited Villawood Detention Center, a place for 
				illegal migrants and asylum seekers, every Friday, as a Christian missionary.
				
				One of those migrants, a Ghanaian, had been at the detention center for up-to six years,
				and he corresponded with immigration officials, regularly.
				
				The author thought of building a website that will allow these migrants to share their
				experiences with the rest of the world.

				However, the Internet, was still in its infancy, and the author's knowledge was lacking.
				Also there were only dial-up access, at that time;
				and the inmates at Villawood, did not have computer access.

				Like Jacob, the author's biological father is the second born, 
				and the author is the second twin.

				I lived in Australia, Down Under, which is in the Asia-Pacific geographical region, for seven years; 
				we can see a demarcation, West and East Germany, North and South Italy.
				Tokunbo is the author's biological father's fourth child, and she gave birth to twins.
