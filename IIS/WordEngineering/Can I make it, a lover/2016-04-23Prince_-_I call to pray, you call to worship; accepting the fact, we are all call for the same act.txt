I call to pray, you call to worship; accepting the fact, we are all call for the same act.
Little plenty can do; if plenty is mighty.
The classes show, you taught us to love.
Ever the present day, never will you be gone.
Across aspread; the distance showed no light; except the one standing for you and I.

We will find you one day; but gone, will you not be after.
One built us; never deserting the future.
One or I; this is one for many.
Choosing a lifetime, when worthy was the music.
This is one man; he said it; how to be many, in front of us.

Party, never last, so life.
A heart, you never spend alike.
Man, himself for all.
We heard you, and we talked to you; never understanding the separation.
One man, who stood for all; never stand as a separation.

Life will never depart; without singing all along.
You could have waited, but where is the chance for the opening.
It is a noise, some will say; but noise never challenge man, to be the best.
We worship alike; we speech all along.
A constand reminder of all the rest; is a constant reminder, of all the life, after.

Thinking beyond all.
That is what I say alike, that is what I say beyond you.
Never understanding the separation; here is my guest.
To beyond time; is to beyond relaxing in the future.
Bring my shade color.

Money giving without.
Never departing from the future.
For a son, for a type.
The chance of resting; accepting alike.
Making time, the distribution.

If you could, look after.
Meeting my elevator up.
If I could speak; this is my song.
A man shared his thought, we share our believe.
Note time; this is acknowledgement of color, as my special guide.

I placed them, at your hand; you placed them, in my heart.
