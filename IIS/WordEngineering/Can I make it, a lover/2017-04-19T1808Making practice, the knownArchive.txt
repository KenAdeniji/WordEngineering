As often, as He is relevant.
	Never realizing, the failure of man.
		As God declared, His judgment on the fallen man; He still made known, a redeemer.
		Life is never a distant from who I am.
		As long, as I am dependant in Him; I am favorable to Him.

Knowing a true person.
	Time is one of the factor, I have made, unknown.
		As I departed from the truth; truth is transfer of me.
		All I have of Him; is all, I have made of Him, and I.
		Myself, is never hesitant, of the beginning.
		
Necessary of someone else.
	I have taken some of Him; so I will never be taken, out of Him.

In need of no partiality, of the realization.
When life is done, life seem to matter, after all.


Where I made known of life; is where I made known, the necessity of living.
