Speech of my language.
When you can wake-up beside me; and say the past time, is as I meant?
When nothing separate us; as our forever, will never end.
When yesterday and tomorrow, bring us together.
Our time, will last; never passing.

A second from the beginning; will never spend a second, without you.
Ever be the same, as someone else; is ever be the same, from the beginning.
To hope, we never make our separate end.
To hope the time we spend, is time, as we are meant to.
Once upon a time; I said, begin will last.

How can you say, love will pass time?
How can you say, I will never be the same as you?
How can you say, our trial will always last?
Our love is not finding you.
If I am alike; that will be, our the same.

No wonder, where I Am given; except I Am bringing, My beginning.
Never be long, when I am searching for my beginning.
Never be after time, when nothing matter as the present.
To be after time, is to be up-to.
Up-to now, will never pass; now,  is the present.

May be time, will choose last?
My prayer for my time; is time, will never cease from my present.
With all life; here is my above, serving my present.
No one will cease to be gone, when time is said new.
Oh life, will you ever be my conscience; that I may talk through you.

A period of my the same; is never declining, from my former.
Oh, I hope, our hope, should be the rest.
Ever be gone, here is my beginning with you; and it should be the present.
A view of the past; is thanks to the present.
Where life, will ever spent; from the beginning.
