When you are in a dilemma, or a problem is pose to you; pray and vocalize your understanding of the problem.
Relax, and go to sleep; and wait for God to give you a solution.
The recommendation may come in word; or earlier taken, by your predecessor.
Record the information, and measure God's progress.
