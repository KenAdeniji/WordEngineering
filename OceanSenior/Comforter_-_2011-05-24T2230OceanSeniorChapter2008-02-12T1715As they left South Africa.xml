		<example>
			Dream: I am in a train. A man walks to the front, ask the driver for permission to open the NorthEast door. He opens the door with a key, and jumps out to the bush, Eastward. These are only training sessions. Initially, the training started with many animals, probably sacrificial offerings. but God has made them all, through Jesus Christ, His son. The ratio of animals requirement has fallen, reduced by thousands. Our population as we exhaust his end. Supposedly, my twin sibling wrestled with me as I attempted to write down the statement not the entire dream. But, I soon found out this is only my illusion, the particular minute, I got up to write.
