Hello Ken Adeniji
 
My name is Akash Kumar and I am a Staffing Specialist at VSG Business Solutions LLC. I am reaching out to you on an exciting job opportunity with one of our clients.
 

Canvas App Developer

100% Remote

Any Visa

 

The solution:

 

"The Canvas App for VRAS uses a Dataverse backend that contains records from registrants who used the PowerApps portal to sign up to receive a vaccine. The use case for the VRAS Canvas App is there is a vaccination site where a volunteer uses the app to scan a QR code that was sent to the registrant (or searches by email/phone/name) to pull up their record and verify their information. Once checked in, the registration gets in queue and then a nurse (or volunteer that is able to administer a vaccine) scans the registrants QR code (or searches by email/phone/name) to pull up their record and gets a screen that has vaccination information. The nurse then scans a 2nd Data matrix code that has the specific vaccine information (Lot#/Expiration/Manufacturer) which populates the information on the screen and then the nurse administers the dose and marks the record as having the dose registered. Once the dose is registered, there are several processes (flows/real-time workflows/plugins) that complete the process by generating an HL7 message to send the vaccination record to the state vaccination database

 

 

    Portal experience
    C# and JavaScript programming languages

ac.mta2vsmtp.cc.aws-usw2b.prd.sparkpost rejected your message to the following email addresses:

Talent Junction LLC Talent Network (talent-junction@marketing.jobs.net)Your message couldn't be delivered because an email server outside Office 365 reported an error that it couldn't relay your message. It's likely that the email server isn't correctly set up to receive and relay messages from your domain. To fix this, forward this non-delivery report (NDR) message to your email admin.

For Email AdminsThe sender's message was routed to an email server outside Office 365 but that email server returned the error below. It's likely that the email server that reported error isn't set up correctly to receive and relay messages sent from the sender's domain. The server is not an Office 365 server - it will usually be one of your on-premises servers in a hybrid environment, a server at a smart host email service that you're trying to route messages through, or possibly even a server at an email hosting service you used in the past yet still have mail flow settings pointing to (for example, when your MX record at your domain registrar still points to your previous email service provider).

To fix this, check the server name to determine what domain, service, or server is reporting the error. The email server needs to be configured to either accept messages from anonymous users or to include the sending domain or sending IP address in its list of authenticated senders. On an Exchange server, you can set this up in the server's receive connector. If it's a smart host managed by another service or partner, contact the service or partner to configure their servers to accept and relay messages from your senders. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure your MX records are properly configured.

Since the problem is likely due to misconfigured settings on an email server outside Office 365, unfortunately Office 365 support won't be able to help fix this issue.
